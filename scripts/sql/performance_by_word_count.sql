/*
 * Performance Analysis Stratified by Word Count
 * 
 * Purpose: Analyzes cycle duration performance separately for cases with >600 words
 * vs 300-600 words in their transcripts. This reveals how transcript length affects
 * optimal cycle duration selection.
 * 
 * Usage: Run this to understand if longer transcripts benefit from different
 * cycle durations than shorter ones. Critical for personalized cycle duration
 * recommendations based on transcript characteristics.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Stratifies cases into ">600 words" and "300-600 words" categories
 * - Uses only cases with complete data across all 7 cycle durations
 * - Proper rubric score normalization
 * - Equal sample sizes for fair comparison (balanced experimental design)
 * 
 * Expected Results: 
 * - Long cases (>600 words) typically perform better with 30s cycles (~84% mean)
 * - Medium cases (300-600 words) perform best with 60s cycles (~74% mean)  
 * - Long cases consistently outperform medium cases by 6-15 percentage points
 * - Both categories show performance degradation at 180s+ cycles
