hyperscribe
===========

Plugin inserting commands based on the content of an audio, discussion between a patient and a provider.

## Components

The plugin provides these components:

- [launcher](handlers/launcher.py): button in the header of the note (UI) to start the recording
- [reviewer](handlers/reviewer_button.py): button in the header of the note (UI) to review the LLM decisions
- [tuning_launcher](handlers/tuning_launcher.py): button in the header of the note (UI) to start the recording for tuning purpose

## Set up

In your home directory, add to `~/.canvas/credentials.ini` the host you have access to:

```shell
[my-canvas-host]
client_id=...
client_secret=...
```

(as described in the [Canvas Plugin Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2JOEElq2ck) video)

To be able to locally run your code against your remote instance (`my-canvas-host.canvasmedical.com`), create the environment variables:

```shell
export IS_SCRIPT=0 # or provide the database access through CANVAS_SDK_DB_URL
export CANVAS_SDK_DB_NAME="..."
export CANVAS_SDK_DB_USERNAME="..."
export CANVAS_SDK_DB_PASSWORD="..."
export CANVAS_SDK_DB_HOST="..."
export CANVAS_SDK_DB_PORT=000
```

## Useful commands

Install the plugin or re-install it while keeping the secrets

```shell
canvas install --host my-canvas-host hyperscribe 
```

Disable an installed plugin, while keeping the secrets

```shell
canvas disable --host my-canvas-host hyperscribe 
```

Uninstall an installed plugin, and remove its secrets

```shell
canvas uninstall --host my-canvas-host hyperscribe 
```

Tail the logs of the remote canvas instance

```shell
canvas logs --host my-canvas-host 
```

## Plugin _secrets_

The `secrets` are stored in the Canvas instance database and can be upsert in `https://my-canvas-host.canvasmedical.com/admin/plugin_io/plugin/`.

The logs, mainly the communication with the LLMs, are stored in a `AWS S3 bucket` if credentials are provided as listed above. The credentials must belong to an AWS IAM user with username following the format `hyperscribe-{canvas_instance}`.

The `AuditLLMDecisions` secret directs the LLM to provide, or not, the rationale used at each step, giving a better understanding of the command
generation. When set, the audit is generated at the end of the session, and it can be viewed through the `Reviewer` button.

The audits are saved in the provided `AWS S3 bucket`.

The logs are saved following the folder structure:

```shell
AwsBucket
      |- hyperscribe-{canvas_instance}
           |- audits - all audit files
           |- finals - concatenated logs of each cycle
           |- llm_turns - log of each LLM communication
           |- partials - logs of each step
```

## Unit tests

The `hyperscribe` code is tested with `pytest` and discussed in this [README.md](../README.md)
