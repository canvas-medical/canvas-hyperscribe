Right now, Hyperscribe reviews the commands that have been originated in a note when the session begins and fills in information from the transcript. Sometimes, clinicians have already filled in part of the note before the session starts with guidance for the visit. Hyperscribe should intake the existing context from the notes and consider this as guidance for the visit. For an example of the text that is already filled in at the beginning of the visit, see artifacts/Visit with Prefilled Text.png. Rather than deleting \'93current concerns with memory or cognition,\'94 Hyperscribe should treat this information as another part of the template and pass this along to the History of Present Illness command in the form of a custom prompt. The context given to the LLM should be \'93The text in this field was entered by the clinician before the visit. This text is guidance that the clinician is providing to the scribe and should serve as a template for the output placed in each command.}
