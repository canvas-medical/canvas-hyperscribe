  "Patient 6": "A 29-year-old man, recently diagnosed with Crohn's disease, has been managing his symptoms with mesalamine 2.4 g daily. Initially, he was prescribed prednisone for acute flares, but due to significant weight gain and mood swings, the decision was made to taper off. His family history is notable for autoimmune conditions, which influenced the choice of mesalamine. He has no known drug allergies, but his busy schedule as a software developer often leads to missed doses, impacting his symptom control."
