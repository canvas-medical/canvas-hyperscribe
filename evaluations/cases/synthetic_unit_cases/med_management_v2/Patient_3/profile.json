  "Patient 3": "A 10-year-old boy with asthma and a history of eczema. He uses an albuterol inhaler as needed and takes montelukast daily. His family history is significant for atopic conditions, with both parents having allergies. There is no documented history of medication allergies. His medication regimen was adjusted last year to include montelukast due to frequent asthma exacerbations."
