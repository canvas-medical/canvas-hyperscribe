    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I understand your concern. Bruising can happen with warfarin. When was your last INR check?"

    "speaker": "Patient",

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Given the bruising and your INR results, we might need to adjust your warfarin dose. Have you had any changes in your diet or new medications?"

    "text": "No new medications, but I did start eating more leafy greens. Could that be affecting it?"
