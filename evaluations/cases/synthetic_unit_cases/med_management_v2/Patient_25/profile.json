  "Patient 25": "Patient 25 is a 12-year-old girl with a history of epilepsy, currently managed with levetiracetam. Her past medical history is otherwise unremarkable, and there is no documented family history of neurological disorders. She has no known allergies. Her medication was switched from valproic acid due to concerns about weight gain and potential liver enzyme elevation."
