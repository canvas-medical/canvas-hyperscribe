  "Patient 25": "A 75-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been using tiotropium inhaler daily for maintenance. He was recently prescribed prednisone for a COPD exacerbation, which he completed without complications. He lives alone and occasionally forgets to refill his inhaler on time, leading to gaps in his medication use. He has no known drug allergies and is otherwise in stable health."
