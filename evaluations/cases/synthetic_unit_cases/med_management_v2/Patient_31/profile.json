  "Patient 31": "Patient 31 is a 67-year-old female with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She is currently taking amlodipine and atorvastatin to manage her conditions. Her medical records indicate a family history of cardiovascular disease, with her father having suffered a myocardial infarction at age 60. She has no known drug allergies. In the past, her medication regimen was adjusted due to muscle pain associated with a previous statin, which was subsequently switched to atorvastatin."
