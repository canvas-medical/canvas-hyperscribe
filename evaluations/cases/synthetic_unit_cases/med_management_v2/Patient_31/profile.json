  "Patient 31": "A 62-year-old retired librarian has been managing her hypertension with lisinopril 10 mg daily for the past five years. Recently, she developed a persistent cough, prompting a switch to losartan 50 mg daily, which she tolerates well. She has a family history of cardiovascular disease, which influences her adherence to medication. Her only other medication is atorvastatin 20 mg daily for hyperlipidemia, which she started after her brother's heart attack last year."
