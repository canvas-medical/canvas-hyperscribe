  "Patient 2": "This 68-year-old retired mechanic has been managing type 2 diabetes with metformin 1000 mg twice daily for over a decade. Due to recent suboptimal glycemic control, glipizide 5 mg daily was added. He also takes aspirin 81 mg daily for cardiovascular protection. His medication adherence is complicated by occasional forgetfulness, but his wife assists with his medication schedule. He has a history of smoking, which he quit five years ago, and no known drug allergies."
