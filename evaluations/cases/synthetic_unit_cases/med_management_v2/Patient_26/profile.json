  "Patient 26": "A 60-year-old retired librarian has been managing her osteoarthritis with acetaminophen as needed for the past five years. Recently, she was started on meloxicam 7.5 mg daily due to increased joint pain, but she experienced gastrointestinal discomfort, leading to a switch to celecoxib 100 mg daily. She has a family history of hypertension, which she monitors closely, though she is not currently on any antihypertensive medications. She is allergic to penicillin, which limits some antibiotic options."
