  "Patient 21": "A 54-year-old woman, who works as a chef, has been managing her hypertension with losartan 50 mg daily after experiencing a persistent cough on lisinopril. She has a family history of cardiovascular disease, which has made her vigilant about her health. Her medication adherence is excellent, but she occasionally misses doses during busy work shifts. She has no known drug allergies and has been advised to monitor her blood pressure regularly at home."
