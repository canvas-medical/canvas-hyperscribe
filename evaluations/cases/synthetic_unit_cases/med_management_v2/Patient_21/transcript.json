    "text": "That's good to hear. Have you noticed any side effects from the tiotropium?"
  },

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Not really, but sometimes I feel a bit dry in the mouth. It's not too bothersome though."
  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Okay, that's a common side effect. As for your blood pressure, how are you doing with the lisinopril?"

    "text": "The lisinopril seems to be working fine. I haven't had any issues with it, unlike the beta-blockers before."
