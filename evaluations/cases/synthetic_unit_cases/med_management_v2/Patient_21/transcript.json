    "speaker": "Clinician",
    "text": "That's a good question. If you remember within a few hours, it's usually okay to take it. But if it's almost time for your next dose, it's better to skip it and just continue with your regular schedule."

    "text": "I understand, and it's great that you're so vigilant. Just keep monitoring your blood pressure at home, and if you notice any unusual changes, let me know."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I will. And, um, about the cough I had with lisinopril, there's no chance of that coming back with losartan, right?"
  },

    "speaker": "Clinician",
    "text": "No, losartan works differently, so it shouldn't cause a cough like lisinopril did. If you do experience any new symptoms, though, just give me a call."
