1,"Reward for clearly documenting the patient-reported missed warfarin dose, the pill-organizer intervention instituted by the daughter, and the patient’s current adherence status.",20,90.0,18.0,"Note documents missed warfarin dose, daughter’s pill-organizer intervention, and describes current adherence (“able to attend frequent checks”)."
2,Reward for recording warfarin safety monitoring details: current/future INR check arrangements and explicit review (with findings) of bleeding or bruising symptoms.,25,60.0,15.0,"Bleeding/bruising review present; mentions “frequent monitoring,” but no specific INR value, target range, or scheduled date."
3,Reward for capturing relevant social determinants of health that impact care (daughter’s assistance with medication management and transportation to appointments).,10,95.0,9.5,"Clearly states daughter created pill organizer and provides transportation to monitoring visits, addressing both SDoH elements."
4,"Reward for explicitly linking the patient’s chronic kidney disease to anticoagulation management decisions, demonstrating evidence-based consideration of comorbidity risk.",15,0.0,0.0,No reference to patient’s CKD or how it affects anticoagulation decisions.
5,"Penalize for including redundant or extraneous information not discussed in this encounter segment (e.g., full historical problem lists, unrelated medications, or verbatim transcript repetition) or for excessive wordiness that obscures key details.",15,10.0,1.5,"Entry is brief and focused; contains no redundant problem lists or transcript filler, so only minimal penalty warranted."
6,"Penalize for omitting or failing to specify a clear, guideline-consistent plan for ongoing INR monitoring and follow-up (e.g., target range, next check date, responsible party).",15,90.0,13.5,"Fails to outline target INR, next check date, or who will follow results; represents a substantial omission."
