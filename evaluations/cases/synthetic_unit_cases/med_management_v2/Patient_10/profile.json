  "Patient 10": "A 75-year-old retired farmer with a history of atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease is on warfarin, with INR levels closely monitored. He was previously on dabigatran, but renal function decline necessitated the switch. His medication regimen is complicated by polypharmacy, including medications for hypertension and heart failure. He lives alone, and occasional forgetfulness has led to missed doses, raising concerns about anticoagulation management. His daughter assists with medication management, ensuring compliance."
