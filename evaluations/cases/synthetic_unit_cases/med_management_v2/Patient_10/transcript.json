    "speaker": "Patient",

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Okay, do you recall how often you take the blood pressure medication or the pain medication?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "The blood pressure one is every day, I think. The pain medication is just when I need it, maybe a couple of times a week."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "That helps. Since we're not sure about the exact medications, would you be open to starting a new blood pressure medication that we can monitor closely?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yes, that sounds good. I just want to make sure my blood pressure stays under control."
