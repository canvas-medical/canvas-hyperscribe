    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It's been a bit tricky, honestly. Some days I just, um, completely forget the evening dose when I'm caught up with assignments."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "That's a good idea. I think I could try the reminder. I just don't want to, you know, mess up the treatment."
