Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,"Reward for documenting a detailed HPI that explicitly captures (a) the patient’s report of improved breathing on the current prednisone course, (b) the approximate two days remaining on that course, (c) the patient/wife’s concern about long-term steroid effects, and (d) the mild jitteriness side effect.",20,30.0,6.0,HPI content is mostly absent; only captures the 2 days remaining on prednisone and mentions jitteriness. It omits the documented improvement in breathing and the couple’s concern about long-term steroid effects.
2,"Reward for accurate medication reconciliation that lists tiotropium inhaler and the current short-course prednisone with dosages if known, and explicitly notes that the patient is not using any other inhalers or respiratory medications.",15,75.0,11.25,"Medication list includes prednisone taper and tiotropium with clear sigs and quantities, but does not explicitly state that no other inhalers or respiratory drugs are used."
3,"Reward for an evidence-based assessment and plan that (i) assesses stable COPD status post steroid burst, (ii) continues tiotropium as maintenance therapy, (iii) discontinues prednisone after completion of the short course without refill, and (iv) specifies follow-up or monitoring instructions for symptom recurrence or steroid side effects, ensuring patient safety.",25,65.0,16.25,"Plan continues tiotropium, stops prednisone after completion, and advises monitoring for worsening jitteriness, but it lacks an explicit assessment of stable COPD status and follow-up for recurrence of symptoms."
4,"Reward for documenting patient education/counseling that explains the short-term risk–benefit of prednisone, reassures about common side effects, and instructs the patient to report worsening jitteriness or any concerning adverse effects.",15,40.0,6.0,Provides minimal counseling—only to call if jitteriness worsens; no explanation of risk–benefit of short steroid burst or reassurance about common side effects.
5,"Reward for use of appropriate, non-redundant Canvas instruction types (e.g., HistoryOfPresentIllness, Medication, Assess for COPD, StopMedication/Refill decisions, Instruct on inhaler use) with content that accurately reflects the transcript.",15,70.0,10.5,"Uses appropriate Prescribe and Instruct commands with accurate content and no redundancy, but omits other relevant instruction types (e.g., HPI entry) and issues a new prescription for an existing maintenance drug instead of a ContinueMedication command."
6,"Penalize for inclusion of redundant, copy-pasted, or clinically irrelevant information not supported by the transcript or chart (e.g., unrelated conditions, repeated phrases, boiler-plate ROS/PE that was not performed).",10,90.0,9.0,"No obvious irrelevant or duplicated information; details given are clinically pertinent, so minimal penalty warranted."
