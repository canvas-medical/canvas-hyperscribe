    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Hi, Doctor. I take a few pills, but I'm not sure of all their names. I know one is for blood pressure."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Okay, that's a start. Do you remember the color or shape of the pills? That might help us identify them."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "One is a small white pill, and another is a larger blue one. I think the blue one is for cholesterol."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "That sounds like it could be a statin for cholesterol. Do you recall any side effects or issues with these medications?"
  },

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Not really, but sometimes I feel dizzy. I'm not sure if it's related to the pills or something else."
