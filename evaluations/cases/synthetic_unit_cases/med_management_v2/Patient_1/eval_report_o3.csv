Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,"Reward for accurately documenting the current antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications with exact names (losartan, atorvastatin), dosages (50 mg daily, 10 mg nightly), duration on therapy (≈1 month for losartan), patient-reported adherence, and explicit absence of expected side-effects (no cough on losartan, no muscle aches on atorvastatin)",25,70.0,17.5,"Names (losartan, atorvastatin), duration (~1 mo), adherence and absence of side-effects documented, but exact dosages (e.g., 50 mg, 10 mg) are completely missing."
2,"Reward for capturing home blood-pressure monitoring details, including typical in-range readings, the single stress-related elevated value, and the clinician’s instruction to report any persistent elevations",20,75.0,15.0,"Notes typical control (“mostly within target range”) and one stress-related spike; gives instruction to report persistent elevations, but lacks specific numeric readings."
3,"Reward for including patient-education counseling given during the visit—continue regular BP checks, take atorvastatin at night, and secure adequate medication supply before travel/refills",15,70.0,10.5,Provides counseling to continue BP monitoring and secure adequate supply before travel; does not explicitly remind patient to take atorvastatin at night.
4,"Reward for specifying an evidence-based safety/monitoring plan (e.g., ordering or confirming recent renal function and potassium labs within 4–6 weeks of losartan start and a lipid panel for statin efficacy) or clearly documenting why such monitoring is not needed",15,5.0,0.75,No mention of renal/k⁺ labs after losartan start or lipid panel for statin; no stated reason for omission.
5,"Penalize for inclusion of redundant or copy-pasted chart information not newly addressed in the encounter (e.g., full past history or medication list repeated without updates)",10,95.0,9.5,Documentation is concise with no obvious copy-pasted past history or full med list.
6,"Penalize for failing to document a clear follow-up plan or contingency instructions if BP remains uncontrolled, thereby creating a potential patient-safety gap",15,40.0,6.0,Gives contingency to report elevated BP but lacks concrete follow-up interval or plan if BP remains uncontrolled.
