    "text": "Morning, Doctor. I've been okay, but I've noticed some swelling in my ankles recently."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I see. That could be related to your lisinopril. Have you noticed any other side effects?"
  },

    "text": "Not really, just the swelling. It's been a bit uncomfortable."
  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "We might need to adjust your lisinopril dose or consider an alternative. How's your blood pressure been?"
  },

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It's been a bit higher than usual, around 150 over 90."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Alright, we may need to increase your lisinopril dose slightly or add another medication to better control your blood pressure. How's your adherence to your current regimen?"
  },

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I've been taking them as prescribed, but sometimes I forget the evening dose."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Thanks for letting me know. We can discuss strategies to help with that. Let's also review your kidney function tests before making any changes."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Sounds good, Doctor. I want to make sure everything's in check."
