  "Patient 1": "A 45-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia has been on lisinopril 20 mg daily for the past five years. Recently, she reported a persistent cough, leading to a switch to losartan 50 mg daily, which she tolerates well. Her lipid levels are managed with atorvastatin 10 mg nightly. She has no known drug allergies and her family history is significant for cardiovascular disease. She works as a school teacher and has a stable lifestyle, which supports her adherence to the medication regimen."
