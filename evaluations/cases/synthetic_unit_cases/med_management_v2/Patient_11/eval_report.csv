Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,"Reward for clearly and concisely recording in HistoryOfPresentIllness that the patient sometimes forgets to pick up amlodipine, lives alone, uses a pill organizer inconsistently, and reports increased fatigue",20,80.0,16.0,"HPI notes that patient lives alone, forgets refills, and reports fatigue, but does not mention inconsistent pill-organizer use; otherwise concise."
2,"Reward for documenting the adherence counseling given (phone reminders, consistent pill-organizer use) as an Instruct or Plan element",15,95.0,14.25,An Instruct command clearly documents phone reminders and consistent pill-organizer use as adherence counseling.
3,"Reward for capturing the side-effect review: clinician inquiry about ankle/foot swelling (patient denies) and acknowledgement of fatigue as a potential medication effect, placed in ReviewOfSystem or HPI",15,90.0,13.5,"HPI records denial of ankle/foot swelling and presence of fatigue, satisfying side-effect review in correct section."
4,"Reward for including an Assessment entry for Hypertension that notes current amlodipine therapy, the adherence issue, and a plan to continue the same dose pending follow-up",15,0.0,0.0,No Assessment/Plan entry for hypertension with adherence issue or continuation plan was provided.
5,"Penalize for documenting any Prescription, AdjustPrescription, StopMedication, or dosage change that alters amlodipine or adds other medications not supported by the transcript",15,100.0,15.0,"No prescription, dosage change, or additional medication commands were issued; no unsupported therapy changes."
6,"Penalize for redundant or irrelevant information, such as re-listing charted demographics/medications/diagnoses without new context or adding wordy, non-case-specific text",10,90.0,9.0,Notes are succinct without duplicated demographics or irrelevant details; minimal verbosity.
7,"Reward for correctly using Canvas structured instructions (e.g., HistoryOfPresentIllness, Instruct, Assess) without misclassification or conflicting tags",10,85.0,8.5,"Commands correctly use HPI and Instruct sections without conflicts, but missing an Assess entry lowers completeness."
