    "text": "Morning, Doctor. I've been okay, but I feel a bit dizzy sometimes, especially when I stand up quickly."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I see. That could be related to your blood pressure medication, lisinopril. Have you noticed if the dizziness happens at a specific time after taking it?"

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It usually happens in the morning, about an hour after I take my pills."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
