  "Patient 16": "A 62-year-old female with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, currently managed with lisinopril and atorvastatin. She was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes five years ago and takes metformin. Her family history includes a father who had a myocardial infarction at age 55. She has a documented allergy to penicillin, which causes a rash. Her medication regimen was adjusted last year due to elevated liver enzymes, leading to a switch from simvastatin to atorvastatin."
