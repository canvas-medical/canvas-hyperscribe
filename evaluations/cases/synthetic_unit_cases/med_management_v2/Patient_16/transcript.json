    "text": "They're not too severe, but they are noticeable, especially when I'm walking for a while."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I see. We could try reducing the dose to see if that helps with the aches. Would you be comfortable with that approach?"

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yes, I think that would be a good idea. I want to manage my cholesterol, but not at the cost of being in pain."
