She was started on metformin 500 mg twice daily, which she has been taking consistently. She has no known drug allergies and reports no significant side effects. Her father had diabetes, which motivates her to maintain a healthy diet and exercise routine. She occasionally struggles with medication adherence due to her demanding work schedule."
