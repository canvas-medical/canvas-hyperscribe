  "Patient 20": "A 9-year-old boy with a history of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), currently managed with methylphenidate. He has a history of recurrent ear infections but no chronic conditions. His family history is unclear, as he is adopted and has limited information on biological relatives. There are no known allergies documented in his medical record. His medication regimen was adjusted last year to address appetite suppression associated with his ADHD treatment."
