Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,"Reward for accurately documenting the patient’s stated symptoms and concerns: increased hunger/appetite and fear of weight gain since starting glipizide, lower blood-sugar readings, and intermittent ankle swelling after switching to losartan",30,95.0,28.5,"HPI clearly lists increased hunger, worry about weight gain, lower home glucose readings, and new ankle swelling since losartan; all stated patient concerns are captured accurately."
2,"Reward for a focused assessment that explicitly attributes the appetite/weight issue to glipizide, the ankle edema to losartan, notes glipizide’s effectiveness on glycemic control and losartan’s resolution of cough, and classifies the swelling as a potential medication adverse effect",25,85.0,21.25,"Assessments connect appetite increase to glipizide and edema to losartan, highlight improved glycemic control and resolved cough; edema not explicitly labeled ""adverse effect,"" but implication present."
3,"Reward for a safety-oriented management plan that includes monitoring weight and blood glucose, tracking ankle swelling, clear return-precautions for worsening edema, and a contingency to adjust or change medication if side effects persist",20,80.0,16.0,"Plan instructs daily weight monitoring, reporting of persistent swelling/weight gain, and possible therapy adjustment; mentions general monitoring but omits explicit BG checks and detailed return precautions."
4,"Reward for evidence-based counseling that discusses known sulfonylurea-related weight gain and considers dietary adjustment or weight-neutral diabetes agents, and acknowledges the low but real risk of edema with ARBs",15,40.0,6.0,"Only brief diet reminder provided; no discussion of sulfonylurea-related weight gain mechanisms, weight-neutral options, or ARB edema risk."
5,"Penalize for inclusion of content not supported by the transcript—such as extraneous review-of-systems, unrelated historical details, or duplicate information—that unnecessarily lengthens the note",10,5.0,0.5,"Note stays focused on issues in transcript with no extraneous ROS or duplicate material, so minimal penalty required."
