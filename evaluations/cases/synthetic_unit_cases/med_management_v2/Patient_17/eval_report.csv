Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,"Reward for accurately documenting in the HPI the patient-reported symptoms and concerns specific to this segment (increased hunger since starting glipizide, fear of weight gain, relief of ACE-inhibitor cough, new intermittent ankle swelling after starting losartan)",20,90.0,18.0,"HPI clearly records increased hunger on glipizide, patient concern about weight gain, resolution of lisinopril-related cough, and new intermittent ankle swelling after starting losartan."
2,"Reward for a clear Assessment/Plan that links each reported symptom to the corresponding medication, states probable causality, and outlines concrete next steps (e.g., monitor weight and blood sugars, reassess glipizide need, monitor ankle edema and consider losartan dose change/alternative)",25,60.0,15.0,"Assessment links symptoms to medications and advises monitoring, but stops short of asserting causality or outlining concrete alternatives, dose changes, or time-bound follow-up."
3,"Reward for explicit patient-safety counseling and follow-up instructions—documenting education about hypoglycemia signs, guidance to log blood sugars/weights, red-flag edema symptoms, and a defined timeframe or trigger for re-evaluation",20,50.0,10.0,"Provides basic education to monitor weight, follow meal plan, check glucose, and report swelling, but omits hypoglycemia warning signs, red-flag edema advice, and a definite re-evaluation timeframe."
4,"Reward for evidence-based reasoning in medication management (notes glipizide’s weight-gain risk vs. alternatives, confirms ARB use per guidelines after ACE cough, reinforces diet/exercise per ADA/ACC-AHA guidance)",15,30.0,4.5,"Little evidence-based discussion; no mention of sulfonylurea weight-gain risk, ARB guideline justification, or ADA lifestyle reinforcement beyond brief meal-plan note."
5,"Penalize for omission of objective or quantifiable data relevant to the issues (current weight, recent home glucose readings, blood pressure, description/measurement of ankle edema, medication list reconciliation)",10,25.0,2.5,"Objective data largely absent—no current weight, BP, glucose logs, edema description, or exact medication doses recorded."
6,"Penalize for inclusion of redundant, copy-pasted, or irrelevant content not directly related to this encounter segment",10,90.0,9.0,Documentation concise and encounter-focused with no redundant or irrelevant copy-paste material detected.
