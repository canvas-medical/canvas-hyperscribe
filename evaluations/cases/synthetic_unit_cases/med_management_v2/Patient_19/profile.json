  "Patient 19": "This 45-year-old man, a construction worker, has been on albuterol as needed for asthma since childhood. He was recently prescribed fluticasone/salmeterol inhaler for better control after experiencing increased symptoms during the spring. He has no other chronic conditions and no known allergies. His work environment, often dusty, exacerbates his symptoms, making adherence to his new regimen crucial."
