  "Patient 9": "This 38-year-old woman, a single mother of two, was recently started on sertraline 50 mg for major depressive disorder. She has a history of anxiety, previously managed with cognitive behavioral therapy, but recent life stressors necessitated pharmacological intervention. She has no known allergies, but her limited financial resources sometimes affect her ability to fill prescriptions consistently. Her mother also had a history of depression, which was a consideration in her treatment plan."
