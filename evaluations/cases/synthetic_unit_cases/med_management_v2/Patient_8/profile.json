  "Patient 8": "A 45-year-old man with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes has been on a stable regimen of losartan 50 mg and metformin 1000 mg twice daily. He was initially on lisinopril but switched to losartan due to a persistent cough. His father had early-onset cardiovascular disease, prompting aggressive management of his risk factors. He struggles with medication adherence due to his demanding job as a truck driver, often leading to missed doses."
