Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,"Reward for clearly documenting in HistoryOfPresentIllness that the patient missed one warfarin dose last week, experienced no new symptoms, and that his daughter helped him resume therapy",20,95.0,19.0,"HPI clearly notes a single missed warfarin dose last week, absence of new symptoms, and daughter-assisted resumption, fulfilling all elements."
2,Reward for including an Instruct or Task entry that details specific adherence aids (weekly pill box and phone/alert reminders) with an assigned person (patient or daughter) and timeframe,15,60.0,9.0,"Instruct entry lists pill box and phone alerts but does not assign a specific person (only implicitly the patient) and lacks a timeframe, so partially complete."
3,"Reward for documenting an anticoagulation safety plan that covers at least one of the following: patient education not to double warfarin doses, bleeding‐risk warning signs and when to seek care, or instructions to contact clinic if another dose is missed",20,0.0,0.0,"No anticoagulation safety plan (no guidance on not doubling doses, bleeding warnings, or clinic contact) is documented."
4,Reward for ordering or scheduling a follow-up INR test within guideline time-frame (≤4 weeks) and explicitly stating that current warfarin dosing will be maintained unless INR indicates otherwise,15,0.0,0.0,There is no order or plan for follow-up INR within four weeks and no statement about continuing current dosing pending results.
5,Reward for capturing relevant social context (daughter’s involvement and patient’s openness to technology) in Social History or appropriate free text without redundancy,10,50.0,5.0,"Daughter’s involvement captured in HPI and patient’s acceptance of phone alerts implied, but not placed in Social History and limited detail, giving partial credit."
6,"Penalize for inclusion of chart data or narrative unrelated to the transcript (e.g., copying full past medical history, allergies, or review of systems) that does not advance the current encounter",10,0.0,0.0,Note contains no extraneous chart data; therefore no penalty warranted.
7,"Penalize for misusing Canvas instruction types (e.g., combining multiple instructions in one, omitting required single-instruction categories, or placing content in an incorrect category such as safety plan in HistoryOfPresentIllness)",10,0.0,0.0,Commands are used appropriately (separate HPI and Instruct); no misuse observed.
