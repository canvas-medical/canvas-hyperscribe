  "Patient 40": "A 68-year-old retired nurse has been managing her osteoarthritis with ibuprofen as needed. Recently, she developed gastrointestinal discomfort, leading to a switch to celecoxib 100 mg daily, which she finds effective. She has a history of hypertension, controlled with amlodipine 5 mg daily. Her family history includes rheumatoid arthritis, which she monitors for symptoms. She is allergic to aspirin, which limits her pain management options."
