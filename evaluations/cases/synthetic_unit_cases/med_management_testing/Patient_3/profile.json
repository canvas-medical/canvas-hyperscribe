  "Patient 3": "At seventy-two, Mrs. Delgado manages four chronic pills\u2014metformin, glipizide, lisinopril, and simvastatin\u2014but her blood sugar still climbs. Today the clinic started weekly semaglutide injections, with a nurse teaching her how to use the pen under the skin. She worries about cost once she hits the Medicare donut hole, yet has no drug allergies."
