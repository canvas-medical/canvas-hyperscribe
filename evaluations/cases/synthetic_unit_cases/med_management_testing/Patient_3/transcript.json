    "speaker": "Clinician",
    "text": "I appreciate your honesty. First, please don\u2019t ever double up; that can plunge sugar too low. Instead, just wait for the next scheduled dose. Second, regarding the pen: after you twist to 0.25 milligrams you\u2019ll hear one solid click; the second click only confirms delivery into the skin."

    "speaker": "Clinician",
    "text": "Understood. Short term, nausea usually peaks the first two weeks, then eases. Sip ginger tea, eat small meals. We\u2019ll only increase the dose if your stomach tolerates it and sugars stay high later on."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "That would help a lot. If I keep my sugars under 150, will we ever stop the glipizide? It makes me shaky sometimes still."
