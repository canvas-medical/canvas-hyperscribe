Expect dryness, mild burning, maybe worse breakouts the first month\u2014use fragrance-free moisturizer each morning. If you run outside, add SPF 30. One tube should last eight weeks; no early refills approved, so stretch it. Albuterol stays \u2018as needed,\u2019 two puffs, max every four hours."

Also, my inhaler\u2019s empty again, and the pharmacy said no more refills\u2014what am I supposed to do? I feel really lost."
