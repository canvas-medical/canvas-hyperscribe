The airline website is vague; it just says declare medications. I\u2019ve read blogs where people\u2019s ice packs melted during layovers, and I\u2019m worried the drug will degrade before we even reach customs in Madrid. Also, I can\u2019t just pop into a pharmacy in the mountains if something goes wrong. The inhaler is easier\u2014I\u2019ve got two fresh canisters\u2014but I\u2019m not sure about the levothyroxine because the time-zone flip will have me taking it at 2 pm local. Am I overthinking this?"

My cousin said European hotels won\u2019t let you toss needles in regular trash, and I don\u2019t want housekeeping to freak out. Should I pack a travel sharps tube or can the pen needle go back on and stay until we get home? I\u2019m trying to be responsible, but the space in my backpack is tight because of the hiking gear and the rescue inhaler spacer."

Could I shift gradually this week\u2014maybe thirty minutes earlier each day\u2014so by the time we land I\u2019m already synced? I don\u2019t want hypo symptoms while hiking out there either, okay?"

    "speaker": "Clinician",
    "text": "Yes, titrating earlier is fine. Shift thirty minutes each morning, stop at local 6 a.m. Make sure you still take it on an empty stomach, then wait thirty minutes before breakfast."

Could you authorize mail-order for three inhalers and maybe one extra dupilumab in case of breakage? I\u2019ll pay out-of-pocket if needed to avoid any panic."
