    "speaker": "Clinician",
    "text": "Heartburn is more likely from the tacos than the statin, yet let\u2019s stay vigilant. The dose increase roughly doubles the LDL-lowering effect, not the side-effect risk. Still, I\u2019ll order liver enzymes with your June labs."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Alright, but if the formulary switches brands again, do I need a new lab sooner? My neighbor said the cheaper generic gave her joint stiffness, and I don\u2019t want surprises right before my granddaughter\u2019s graduation trip."
