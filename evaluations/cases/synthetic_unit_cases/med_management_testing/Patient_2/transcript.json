We\u2019re bumping lisinopril up to forty milligrams once every morning, still with or without food. You don\u2019t need a second trip; the pharmacist will simply give you the larger-strength tablet and tell you to start tomorrow. Take a moment to, uh, breathe\u2014this isn\u2019t a failure on your part. High blood pressure can be stubborn, especially with our family histories and a stressful commute."

If any of that pops up, call us even if it\u2019s after hours\u2014our exchange will page me, and I\u2019d rather lose sleep than have you, I mean, faint in the stacks at work. Keep sipping water; dehydration makes lisinopril hit harder. Because the drive is so long, bring your pill bottle when you come to town, and we\u2019ll, uh, run a quick kidney panel the same morning to make sure creatinine is holding steady."

I\u2019m writing this as a ninety-day supply with two refills, but the insurance flags errors if the blood-pressure readings aren\u2019t uploaded. So once a week email me a photo of your log\u2014just the page, no selfies\u2014and I\u2019ll certify it in the system. That way the mail-order warehouse ships directly to your porch and you won\u2019t burn gasoline chasing pills. Set a phone alarm for eight a.m.; consistency beats potency. And if a dose is missed, simply take it when you remember unless it\u2019s nearly the next morning\u2014never double."
