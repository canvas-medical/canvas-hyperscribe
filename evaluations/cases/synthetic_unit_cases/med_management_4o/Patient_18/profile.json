  "Patient 18": "A 72-year-old retired teacher, living alone, has been on warfarin for atrial fibrillation for several years. She has a history of falls, which complicates her anticoagulation management. Her daughter, who lives out of state, helps manage her medications remotely. Recently, her INR levels have been unstable, possibly due to dietary changes, and her cardiologist is considering a switch to a direct oral anticoagulant for easier management."
