  "Patient 12": "This 67-year-old retired postal worker has been on warfarin for atrial fibrillation for over a decade. His INR levels have been stable, but he occasionally misses doses due to forgetfulness. He also takes atorvastatin 20 mg for hyperlipidemia, which he started after a mild myocardial infarction three years ago. His daughter helps manage his medications, ensuring he attends regular follow-ups. He has a known allergy to penicillin, which is well-documented in his records."
