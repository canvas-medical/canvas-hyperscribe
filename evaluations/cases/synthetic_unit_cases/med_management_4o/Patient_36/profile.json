  "Patient 36": "A 60-year-old retired firefighter has been managing his hypertension with lisinopril 10 mg daily for the past five years. Recently, he reported a persistent cough, prompting a switch to losartan 50 mg daily, which he tolerates well. He has a family history of cardiovascular disease, which influences his adherence to medication. He is allergic to penicillin, which limits antibiotic choices when needed. His active lifestyle and regular exercise have positively impacted his blood pressure control."
