Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,"Reward for accurately documenting the patient's HPI details from this segment, specifically: inconsistent amlodipine pickup, difficulty keeping track while living alone, current use of a pill organizer yet inconsistent use, and new onset fatigue.",20,75.0,15.0,"HPI captures inconsistent amlodipine pickup, patient lives alone, and new-onset fatigue, but omits that the patient already owns a pill organizer and uses it inconsistently."
2,"Reward for explicitly recording the current antihypertensive medication (amlodipine 10 mg) with dosage, and noting the clinician-led inquiry about common amlodipine side effects (ankle/foot swelling) with the patient's negative response plus the reported fatigue.",15,60.0,9.0,Lists amlodipine but leaves out the 10 mg dosage; documents negative ankle/foot swelling inquiry and fatigue complaint.
3,"Reward for documenting the clinician's adherence-support counseling (suggested phone reminders and consistent pill-organizer use) as part of the plan, showing evidence-based self-management education.",25,95.0,23.75,"Plan clearly records clinician advice to set phone reminders and use pill organizer consistently, covering the two specified adherence supports."
4,"Penalize for failing to include a patient-safetyâ€“focused plan related to hypertension control and amlodipine monitoring (e.g., follow-up blood-pressure checks, monitoring for peripheral edema, or evaluation of fatigue etiology).",25,10.0,2.5,"No documented plan for BP follow-up, edema monitoring, or fatigue work-up, so safety measures are essentially absent."
5,"Penalize for inclusion of redundant, irrelevant, or copy-pasted information not supported by this transcript segment or for omitting the social determinant detail that the patient lives alone.",15,90.0,13.5,Includes the key social detail that patient lives alone and adds no irrelevant copy-paste content.
