  "Patient 27": "This 45-year-old man, a long-haul truck driver, has been on metformin 1000 mg twice daily for type 2 diabetes for the past decade. Due to recent weight gain and suboptimal glycemic control, his endocrinologist added empagliflozin 10 mg daily. He has a history of smoking, which he quit two years ago, and his father had early-onset coronary artery disease. He reports occasional missed doses due to his irregular work schedule."
