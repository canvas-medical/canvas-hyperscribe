1,"Reward for documenting the patient's progress in carb counting and insulin dose adjustment, reflecting an understanding of the patient's self-management skills.",20,0.0,0.0,"The hyperscribe output is empty, so there is no documentation of the patient's progress in carb counting and insulin dose adjustment."
2,"Penalize for omitting the patient's difficulty with estimating carbs when eating out, as this is a key barrier to effective diabetes management.",15,0.0,0.0,"The hyperscribe output is empty, so the patient's difficulty with estimating carbs when eating out is omitted."
3,"Reward for including the patient's use of apps for carb counting, as this reflects an evidence-based approach to managing diabetes.",15,0.0,0.0,"The hyperscribe output is empty, so there is no mention of the patient's use of apps for carb counting."
4,"Penalize for not addressing the need for a follow-up plan to reinforce the habit of using apps for carb counting, which is crucial for patient safety and effective diabetes management.",20,0.0,0.0,"The hyperscribe output is empty, so there is no address of the need for a follow-up plan to reinforce the habit of using apps for carb counting."
5,"Reward for noting the patient's self-reported improvement in carb counting, which is important for assessing progress towards the goal of managing blood sugar levels effectively.",15,0.0,0.0,"The hyperscribe output is empty, so there is no note of the patient's self-reported improvement in carb counting."
6,"Penalize for excessive wordiness or redundancy in documenting the patient's statements, which can obscure critical information.",15,100.0,15.0,"The hyperscribe output is empty, so there is no excessive wordiness or redundancy, but this is due to the lack of content."
