  "Patient 4": "An 82-year-old man with a complex medical history including heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease. He is on a regimen of carvedilol 12.5 mg twice daily, warfarin with INR monitoring, and furosemide 40 mg daily. His medication management is challenging due to fluctuating renal function and dietary inconsistencies. He lives alone, which sometimes leads to missed doses, and his daughter visits weekly to help organize his medications. He is allergic to penicillin."
