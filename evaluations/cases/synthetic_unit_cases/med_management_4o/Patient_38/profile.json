  "Patient 38": "A 72-year-old retired school principal has been on warfarin for atrial fibrillation for over a decade. She has a history of stable INR levels, but recent dietary changes have caused fluctuations, requiring closer monitoring. She lives alone and occasionally misses doses, which has been addressed with a pill organizer. Her daughter, a nurse, assists with her medication management. She is allergic to sulfa drugs, which is noted in her medical records."
