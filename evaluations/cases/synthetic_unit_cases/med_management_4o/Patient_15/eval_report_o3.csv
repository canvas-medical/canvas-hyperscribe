1,"Reward for accurately documenting all patient-reported subjective information from this segment, including improved breathing on prednisone, concern about long-term steroid effects, jitteriness from inhaler, and number of days remaining on the steroid course",20,85.0,17.0,"HPI includes all key subjective items: improved breathing, concern about long-term steroid effects, jitteriness from inhaler, and notes that only “a few doses” remain; however, it omits a precise day count."
2,Reward for complete medication reconciliation: explicitly listing prednisone (with course length/remaining days) and tiotropium (with confirmation of correct use and adherence) and clearly noting the absence of any other inhalers or respiratory medications,25,80.0,20.0,"Med list names prednisone (short course, few doses left), confirms tiotropium correct use and adherence, and states no other inhalers; lacks exact course length or dosing details."
3,"Reward for documenting clinician counseling on prednisone (short course, risk–benefit explanation), anticipated side effects (jitteriness), and clear safety instructions on when to report worsening or bothersome effects",20,65.0,13.0,"Plan advises finishing short course and to report worsening jitteriness, but gives minimal risk–benefit counseling and does not discuss broader steroid side effects."
4,"Reward for recording an evidence-based management plan that aligns with COPD guidelines: finish current short prednisone course without unnecessary extension, continue tiotropium as maintenance therapy, and specify appropriate follow-up arrangements",25,70.0,17.5,"Management continues tiotropium and completes prednisone without extension, consistent with guidelines; omits explicit follow-up arrangement."
5,"Penalize for inclusion of redundant, irrelevant, or copy-pasted material that is not directly pertinent to this encounter segment, leading to excessive or repetitive documentation",10,95.0,9.5,Note is concise with little duplication and no irrelevant copy-pasted material aside from minor repetition of visit reason.
