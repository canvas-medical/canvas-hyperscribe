  "Patient 28": "A 72-year-old woman, living in a rural area, has been on levothyroxine 88 mcg daily for hypothyroidism for over 15 years. She recently experienced palpitations, prompting a dose adjustment to 75 mcg. Her medication adherence is generally good, though she sometimes struggles with access to her pharmacy due to transportation issues. She has no known drug allergies and her family history is unremarkable."
