  "Patient 34": "This 78-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been using tiotropium inhaler daily for several years. He was recently started on prednisone 5 mg daily due to a recent exacerbation. He lives alone and occasionally forgets to take his medications, which has been a concern for his daughter who visits weekly. He has no known drug allergies."
