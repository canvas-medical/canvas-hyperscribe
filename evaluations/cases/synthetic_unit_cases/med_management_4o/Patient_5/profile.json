  "Patient 5": "A 55-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis has been on methotrexate 15 mg weekly for several years, with good control of her symptoms. She also takes folic acid 1 mg daily to mitigate side effects. Recently, she started experiencing increased joint pain, leading to the addition of hydroxychloroquine 200 mg daily. She has a family history of autoimmune diseases and is allergic to sulfa drugs. She works part-time and is actively involved in a local support group, which helps her stay informed about her condition."
