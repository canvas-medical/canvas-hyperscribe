  "Patient 20": "Seventy-seven-year-old Captain Ellis lives on a small lighthouse island reachable only twice weekly by ferry. He just started imatinib tablets for newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia; other medicines include low-dose aspirin and atorvastatin. Because imatinib can suppress blood counts, the hematology team enrolled him in a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program and coordinated ferry vouchers for monthly labs. He reports no known drug allergies."
