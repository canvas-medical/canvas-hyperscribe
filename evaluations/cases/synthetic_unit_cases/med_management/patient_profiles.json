  "Patient 1": "Waving her inhaler, 10-year-old Minh arrives with his mother, who speaks mostly Vietnamese. He has used albuterol alone, but today receives his first prescription for low-dose budesonide inhaled once nightly to calm seasonal asthma flares. Peanuts trigger hives, so the pharmacy will flag any peanut-oil formulations. Follow-up in two months checks technique and adherence.",
  "Patient 2": "Twenty-four-year-old Maya, an uninsured barista planning a backpacking trip abroad, requests a single renewal of sertraline 50 mg by mouth each morning for anxiety. No dose change is needed because symptoms are controlled and she reports no side effects. At the same visit she starts a daily levonorgestrel-ethinyl-estradiol pill for reliable contraception. She is allergic to sulfa antibiotics.",
  "Patient 3": "Living alone on a remote farm, 68-year-old Mr. Harris manages eight medicines for heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and home-dialysis kidney disease. His team plans to add weekly semaglutide, a GLP-1 agonist, to curb diabetes and cut cardiac risk. Because he also takes amiodarone, pharmacists will watch for compounded gut slowing. No drug allergies; mail delivery is arranged for the pen."
