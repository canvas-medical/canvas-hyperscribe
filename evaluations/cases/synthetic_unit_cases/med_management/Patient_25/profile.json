  "Patient 25": "Sixty-four-year-old Mr. Alvarez, a retired electrician living in a coastal village two hours from cardiology services, began nilotinib tablets for chronic myeloid leukemia last month. He also takes lisinopril and simvastatin. Because nilotinib can prolong the QT interval, the team arranged monthly electrocardiograms at the nearby urgent-care clinic and paused his occasional over-the-counter cough syrup that contained dextromethorphan."
