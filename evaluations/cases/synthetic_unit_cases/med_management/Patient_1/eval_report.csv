4,"Reward for documenting the clinician’s instruction to tie dosing to a meal rather than the clock, and the specific guidance that if a meal is delayed >3 hours the patient should wait for a snack with fat (nuts, yogurt) because fasting halves absorption.",15,60.0,9.0,"Includes guidance to wait for snack with fat if >3 h delay, but does not explicitly say to link dose to a meal rather than the clock."
5,"Reward for capturing the patient’s irregular-meal scenario (3 a.m. flight, fieldwork) and her use of reminders, reflecting her adherence concerns.",5,0.0,0.0,Irregular-meal/3 a.m. flight scenario and reminder strategies absent.
