1,"Reward for documenting the patient-reported finger-stick glucose values (>250) and associated symptoms (afternoon fuzzy head, nocturnal thirst) exactly as expressed in the encounter",10,90.0,9.0,"Note clearly states BG >250, afternoon fuzziness, and nocturnal thirst, matching patient wording."
2,"Reward for accurately recording the CURRENT diabetes medication regimen described during the visit (metformin 1000 mg twice daily, glipizide 10 mg with breakfast) and the adherence issues of missed doses and dose-splitting due to cost and stomach burn",15,45.0,6.75,"Includes metformin adherence problems and tablet-splitting, but omits full baseline dose (1000 mg BID) and glipizide 10 mg breakfast dose."
3,"Reward for noting initiation of a semaglutide 0.25 mg weekly starter pen sample, including administration technique (dial, press, hold 10 s) and adverse-event call instructions",15,30.0,4.5,"Has AE call instructions but omits semaglutide 0.25 mg starter pen, sample wording, and dial-press-hold 10 s technique."
4,"Reward for capturing the late-dose guidance for semaglutide (inject if <48 h late, otherwise skip and never double dose)",10,95.0,9.5,"Late-dose rules (<48 h inject, >48 h skip, never double) documented verbatim."
5,Reward for documenting the adjustment of the morning metformin dose to 500 mg with food and the issuance of a coupon to bridge refill gaps,10,70.0,7.0,Morning metformin reduced to 500 mg with food recorded; coupon/bridge not mentioned.
6,"Reward for recording the plan to monitor for hypoglycemia: recheck finger-sticks in two weeks and call if any reading <80 mg/dL, with potential glipizide reduction to 5 mg or discontinuation",12,90.0,10.8,"Recheck in 2 weeks, call if <80 mg/dL, consider glipizide 5 mg or stopâ€”all captured."
7,Reward for including supportive reminder actions (texting daughter a reminder link and setting a pharmacy-app alert),5,95.0,4.75,Both texting daughter and pharmacy-app reminder included exactly.
8,"Reward for overall completeness and fidelity: the note captures all major statements, decisions, and instructions from the transcript without significant omissions or distortions",20,60.0,12.0,"Major decisions present, but misses semaglutide dose/technique and initial glipizide regimen; overall mostly complete."
9,"Penalize for copying medication names or dosages from the pre-visit chart that conflict with what was actually stated (e.g., metformin 500 mg or glipizide 5 mg instead of the spoken 1000 mg BID / 10 mg)",18,90.0,-1.8,No evidence of chart-derived conflicting doses; recorded info aligns with spoken plan.
