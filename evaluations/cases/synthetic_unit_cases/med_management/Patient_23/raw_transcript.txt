Insurance, frustratingly, denied semaglutide, but I pulled a 0.25 mg starter pen from samples—one shot every Sunday. Dial, press, hold ten seconds. If nausea, burping, or a red welt bigger than a coin appears, call the clinic right away."

More than 48 hours, skip and wait for the next scheduled Sunday—never double. I’ll text your daughter a reminder link, and we can set the pharmacy app to chirp Saturday night."

    "speaker": "Clinician",
    "text": "Okay, thanks for saying that. We can cut the morning metformin pill in half to 500 mg with food; that often eases the burn. Keep the night dose whole. I’ll send a coupon to bridge the refill gap so no doses get missed during next month."

    "text": "One more detail: glipizide can cause low sugar once semaglutide starts working. I plan to recheck finger-sticks in two weeks; if any reading drops under 80, call me, and we’ll lower glipizide to 5 mg or stop it outright even in the middle of the night."
