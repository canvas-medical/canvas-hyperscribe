  "Patient 23": "A 45-year-old warehouse supervisor who speaks only Vietnamese attended with her daughter interpreting. Despite metformin and glipizide, her blood sugar logs stay high, so semaglutide injections once weekly were added today. She will pick up the starter pen at the pharmacy, watch bilingual teaching videos, and call if nausea or injection-site redness occurs."
