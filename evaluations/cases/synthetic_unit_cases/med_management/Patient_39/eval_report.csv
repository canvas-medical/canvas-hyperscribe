Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale

2,Reward for capturing the specific incident of possible double-dosing (second tablet taken ~10 minutes after a sneeze on the prior day).,15,95.0,14.25,"Explicitly notes sneeze followed by second dose ten minutes later, capturing double-dosing incident."
3,Reward for recording the patient's adherence routine detail that he now takes the HIV pill each day at 8 a.m. using an alarm.,10,10.0,1.0,Does not mention 8 a.m. alarm or daily timing routine.
4,"Reward for documenting the patient’s concern about omeprazole lowering tenofovir levels and the three options he asked about (move dose to dinner, switch to famotidine, or tolerate heartburn).",15,40.0,6.0,Mentions concern about omeprazole lowering levels but omits the three alternative strategies discussed.
5,Reward for noting that chest burning recurs when the patient skips omeprazole.,5,90.0,4.5,States chest burning occurs when heartburn medication is skipped.
6,Reward for including the patient’s financial concern about amlodipine: only 5 tablets remain and he requests samples or assistance to avoid blood-pressure spike.,15,50.0,7.5,"Notes running low on amlodipine and financial strain but leaves out ""5 tablets left,"" sample request, and BP-spike concern."
7,"Reward for listing HIV disease and essential hypertension as active problems consistent with both transcript and chart, without adding unrelated conditions.",5,15.0,0.75,No separate problem list provided; HIV and hypertension not explicitly listed.
8,"Penalize for omitting or misreporting key numerical details from the encounter (e.g., '5 tablets left', '8 a.m. alarm', 'second dose 10 minutes later').",10,30.0,-7.0,"Includes ""ten minutes later"" but omits ""5 tablets left"" and ""8 a.m."" alarm, so some key numbers missing."
9,"Penalize for copying chart data that the transcript does not make relevant (e.g., full medication lists, empty allergy sections, boilerplate histories) or for fabricating new information not present in either source.",5,95.0,-0.25,Does not import extraneous chart data or fabricate new information outside transcript content.
10,"Reward for overall completeness: the note should coherently capture all patient questions, concerns, and requests raised during the encounter without introducing extra content or leaving major items out.",20,60.0,12.0,"Captures main issues but misses several specific details (timing routine, options, exact tablet count), so completeness is moderate."
