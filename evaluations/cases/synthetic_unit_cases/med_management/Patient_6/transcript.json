The pill in your hand is 20 \u00b5g ethinyl estradiol with 100 \u00b5g levonorgestrel, one tablet every day at the same hour; no breaks\u2014 the last seven are placebo. Starting tonight is fine. Common side-effects: spotting the first two packs, mild nausea, breast tenderness; serious warning signs would be severe leg pain or chest pressure\u2014call immediately if those happen. Because the clinic\u2019s formulary just switched suppliers, you\u2019ll need a new voucher every 28 days; I\u2019ve queued the prescription at Harbor Pharmacy for six months, but you must request the discount card before each refill. Use ibuprofen only if cramps break through."

    "text": "Set a daily alarm on your phone for whatever time you can reliably manage\u2014 even 2 a.m. is okay as long as it\u2019s consistent. If you\u2019re under twelve hours late, just take the pill; over twelve, take one immediately and another at the usual hour tomorrow, then condoms for seven days. Spotting in the first three packs is expected, but call if you soak more than one pad an hour. For cost, ask Harbor for Form K; it\u2019s the manufacturer coupon\u2014 they\u2019ll fax it to me if you forget."
