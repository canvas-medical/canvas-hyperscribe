Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale

2,"Reward for capturing refill/cost logistics: six-month prescription queued at Harbor Pharmacy, new voucher required every 28 days, patient must request Form K manufacturer coupon each time, pharmacy can fax form to clinician.",10,15.0,1.5,"Lists 6-month supply but no Harbor Pharmacy queue, voucher, Form K, or fax logistics."
3,Reward for including explicit instructions on missed pills (<12 h late: take as soon as remembered; >12 h late: take immediately then another at usual time next day and use condoms for 7 days).,15,95.0,14.25,Missed-pill instructions (<12 h vs >12 h and 7-day condoms) clearly documented.
4,"Reward for documenting common side-effects (spotting first 2–3 packs, mild nausea, breast tenderness) and serious warning signs (severe leg pain or chest pressure).",8,0.0,0.0,No mention of common side-effects or serious warning signs.
5,"Reward for noting additional clinical advice: expected spotting guidance (call if soaking >1 pad/hour), use of ibuprofen only for breakthrough cramps, and suggestion to set a daily phone alarm for adherence.",7,30.0,2.1,Gives phone-alarm adherence tip but omits spotting guidance and ibuprofen advice.
6,"Reward for reflecting patient concerns/questions about daily timing with late work shifts, bleeding history, fear of missed-dose consequences, and medication cost.",7,5.0,0.35,"Patient concerns about timing, bleeding, costs not captured."
7,Reward for appropriately incorporating relevant chart context (age 26 female; existing conditions dysmenorrhea and irregular menstruation; current meds ibuprofen and same OCP) without introducing unrelated chart items.,5,0.0,0.0,"No reflection of age, existing dysmenorrhea/irregular menses, or current meds."
8,"Reward for overall completeness: note captures all major clinician instructions, patient questions, and agreed plans with coherent structure.",20,30.0,6.0,Several key clinician elements absent; structure minimal.
9,"Penalize for introducing fabricated or extrapolated clinical content not present in transcript or chart (e.g., additional diagnoses, labs, physical exam findings, alternative dosages).",30,30.0,-21.0,Introduces YAZ and separate LNG prescription not in transcript—moderate fabrication.
10,"Penalize for inaccurate transcription of numerical or medication details (e.g., wrong hormone micrograms, incorrect missed-dose window, wrong backup duration).",20,25.0,-15.0,Hormone combination recorded inaccurately; extra tablet counts; therefore notable numeric errors.
