Keep swallowing with a full glass of water; it lessens that burning you feel. Typical hiccups are mild nausea or a little headache\u2014very few folks your age get anything worse. No need for nighttime doses."

I don\u2019t want anything fighting with the shingles medicine. The caregiver said spacing them an hour is fine, but I want to hear it from you."

    "text": "One more thing: the pharmacist mentioned the home might switch suppliers next week because of a formulary shake-up. If the tablets change color or shape before I finish the pack, should I keep taking them, or stop and call? I don\u2019t want to mix up doses."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Clinician",
    "text": "The vitamin D chew is fine right after lunch\u2014 it won\u2019t clash, even if you chew it. Valacyclovir shares no chemistry with penicillin, so the old throat swelling can\u2019t repeat here. If the pharmacy swaps brands mid-course, the imprint code will change, but potency won\u2019t; keep taking one per blister slot and alert staff, not stop."
