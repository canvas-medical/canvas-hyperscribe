  "Patient 4": "A 14-year-old middle-schooler without health insurance relies on the free clinic for asthma care. He uses albuterol inhaler as needed and fluticasone 110 micrograms twice daily, but nighttime cough persists. Today we increased the fluticasone to 220 micrograms while arranging a voucher so his family can pick up the stronger inhaler at no cost."
