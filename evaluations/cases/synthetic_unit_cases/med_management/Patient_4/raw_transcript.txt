[{"speaker":"Clinician","text":"Okay, so let me lay this out step by step, because I don’t want anything slipping through the cracks before your trip. We’ve bumped your fluticasone from 110 micrograms to 220 micrograms, still two puffs in the morning and two at night, and we’re arranging the voucher so you can pick it up tomorrow. Side-effect watch list: hoarseness, white patches, sore throat—if any of those pop up, rinse and spit after every dose and call us. Keep the albuterol on you, four-to-six puffs max in 24 hours. Sound doable?"},{"speaker":"Patient","text":"Yeah, I guess, but I’ve tried upping meds before and it didn’t really change the coughing at night, so what if this stronger inhaler also, uh, just does nothing? Mom’s already stressed about getting to the clinic before it closes, and my flight’s Sunday dawn. I can’t afford a bad flare mid-trip."},{"speaker":"Patient","text":"I’m still using the spacer like you showed me, and I rinse sometimes, but, honestly, when I’m half-asleep I forget. Could that be why my throat feels scratchy? Also, the albuterol runs out fast—eight puffs last night alone—so I’m worried the stronger steroid isn’t enough."},{"speaker":"Patient","text":"And what about the plane air? My cousin says bring a nebulizer, but that seems overkill—do I just rely on puffs?"}]
