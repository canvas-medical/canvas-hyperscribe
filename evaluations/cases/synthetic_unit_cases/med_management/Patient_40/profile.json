  "Patient 40": "Sixty-seven-year-old retired teacher Ms. Green departs on a six-week cruise through Southeast Asia next month. We continued her weekly under-the-skin semaglutide for diabetes but stopped glyburide to avoid low sugars during excursions. To cover travel, she begins atovaquone/proguanil the day before boarding. Current list also includes atorvastatin and a baby aspirin."
