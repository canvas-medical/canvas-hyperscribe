    "text": "Okay, Ms. Green, quick recap: semaglutide stays 0.5-mg every Sunday morning, fridge until thirty minutes before use. We’ve stopped glyburide entirely; pack it away so you don’t reach for it on the ship. Atovaquone/proguanil begins the morning before embarkation, then one tablet daily with food and milk, continue seven days after you dock home. Any nausea, yellow eyes, or low-sugar shakiness—test first, then email me."

Store pens in the cabin fridge, needle side up. For missed meals, still swallow the malaria pill with even a cracker."
