We\u2019ve stopped glyburide entirely; pack it away so you don\u2019t reach for it on the ship. Atovaquone/proguanil begins the morning before embarkation, then one tablet daily with food and milk, continue seven days after you dock home. Any nausea, yellow eyes, or low-sugar shakiness\u2014test first, then email me."

The purple pen is identical strength; insurer dropped the cheaper brand last week\u2014I\u2019m filing an appeal, but for now I\u2019ve arranged two free boxes at the ship\u2019s infirmary desk. Store pens in the cabin fridge, needle side up. For missed meals, still swallow the malaria pill with even a cracker."
