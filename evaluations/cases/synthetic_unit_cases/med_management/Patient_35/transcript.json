    "text": "Because you\u2019re couch-surfing, I tucked an extra gauze pack and the wallet card into your backpack\u2014could you read back the removal date and the number to call if the skin turns hot, bright red, or starts oozing?"

    "text": "Uh, I\u2019m sorry, I already, um, lost that little card somewhere between my cousin\u2019s sofa and the shelter locker. The bandage looks kinda yellow at the edge, and the drugstore said my ibuprofen refill is maxed out, so I didn\u2019t pick any up."

    "text": "No worries\u2014I wrote the 19 July 2026 removal date on your arm with a skin-safe marker; snap a photo before it fades. The edge stain sounds like dried iodine, but if warmth spreads or you see pus, come in; we\u2019ll swap antibiotics\u2014nothing penicillin-based."

    "text": "About ibuprofen, the pharmacy limit only blocks prescription coupons; over-the-counter bottles run eight bucks, so grab one when you can. Just keep it under 2,400 mg total per day and stop if your stomach burns or you notice black stools, okay?"

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "That\u2019s helpful, but, um, I honestly forget things unless they buzz at me; my phone died last week and I\u2019m borrowing a charger nightly. If I miss those first seven safe days, could I still get pregnant, or does the rod cover me anyway right now?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Also, uh, I can\u2019t remember the last time I bled\u2014it was sometime before my friend\u2019s birthday in April? The spot\u2019s itchy today, and my sister freaked me out saying infections travel fast; do I need a different medicine since penicillin is off the table for me totally?"
