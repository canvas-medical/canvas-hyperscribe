I did take my usual forty units, but my stomach felt heavy, almost queasy, like when the bus ride is too long. The new shot, I mean semaglutide, makes me less hungry, which is nice, yet the scale barely moved. And I’m worried if the pharmacy delays again; I can’t keep asking my cousin to chase papers. What if the pen runs out early? Money is tight, you know, already."
