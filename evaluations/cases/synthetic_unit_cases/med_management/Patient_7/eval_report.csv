Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,Reward for clearly documenting the patient's initial concern that the pills received are a different color and strength (88 micrograms vs prior 100 micrograms).,10,70.0,7.0,"Strength difference (100→88 mcg) documented, but no mention of new tablet color."
2,Reward for capturing the clinician's explanation that the dose was intentionally lowered because the patient's TSH fell below 0.3 and the pharmacy switched to Mylan 88-mcg tablets after a formulary change.,15,60.0,9.0,States dose lowered for TSH <0.3 but omits pharmacy switch/Mylan formulary detail.
3,Reward for accurately recording the dosing instructions for levothyroxine: take one 88-mcg tablet on an empty stomach and wait at least 30 minutes before coffee or breakfast.,15,95.0,14.25,Exact instructions to take 88 mcg on empty stomach and wait ≥30 min before coffee/breakfast included verbatim.
4,"Reward for including the contingency instruction that if the patient accidentally takes a 100-mcg pill, they should NOT double the dose but simply resume 88-mcg the next morning.",10,100.0,10.0,Contingency not to double-dose and to resume 88 mcg next morning captured clearly.
5,Reward for noting the storage guidance to keep the bottle above 59°F and avoid freezing near a window.,5,100.0,5.0,Storage advice to keep >59 °F and avoid freezing near window recorded exactly.
6,Reward for documenting that tablets should not be split and that the clinician is arranging a three-week safety stock shipment before road closures.,8,20.0,1.6,"Mentions patient asking about splitting, but does NOT document ‘do not split’ nor safety-stock shipment."
7,"Reward for capturing counseling on adherence aids (phone alarm, weekly pillbox) and advice about possible symptoms after a double dose (jittery/sweaty) with instruction to call if palpitations persist more than a few hours.",8,100.0,8.0,Phone alarm/pillbox adherence aids and double-dose symptom counseling with call instruction fully included.
8,"Reward for recording the patient's reports of dry skin and nocturnal calf cramps and the clinician's assessment that dry skin is likely due to winter air, cramps may be low magnesium, and not yet a sign of hypothyroidism.",10,40.0,4.0,"Dry skin & nocturnal calf cramps noted, but clinician’s assessment (winter air/low Mg) missing."
9,Reward for documenting the recommendation to try 400 mg magnesium before bed unless contraindicated by kidney issues.,7,0.0,0.0,No recommendation to take 400 mg magnesium; completely absent.
10,Reward for noting the plan to re-check thyroid labs in six weeks with possible dose adjustment.,10,95.0,9.5,Plan to re-check thyroid labs in six weeks with possible adjustment clearly documented.
11,"Penalize for introducing diagnoses, medications, dosages, or counseling that are not supported by the transcript, or for omitting the intentional dose-reduction rationale.",15,25.0,-11.25,Introduced unrelated ‘GM100 kit’ medication; omitted pharmacy-switch rationale → sizeable penalty.
12,"Penalize for copying irrelevant chart data (e.g., unrelated conditions, allergy lists) or for failing to incorporate pertinent chart context (existing hypothyroidism diagnosis and active 88-mcg levothyroxine) when summarizing the encounter.",10,60.0,-4.0,"Little irrelevant chart data, but missing some pertinent context; moderate penalty."
13,"Reward for overall completeness and fidelity: the note accurately reflects the full sequence of dialogue and embedded decisions without significant omissions, distortions, or fabrications.",20,70.0,14.0,"Captures most key elements but misses Mg plan, tablet-splitting advice, formulary detail; adds extraneous item—overall fairly complete."
