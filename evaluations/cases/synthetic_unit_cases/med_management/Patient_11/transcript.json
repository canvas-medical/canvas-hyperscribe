You\u2019re still taking one puff of the orange fluticasone inhaler every morning before school and another right after brushing your teeth at night, yes? The pharmacy says the next refill is blocked until the 28th; that leaves you with maybe three days uncovered. How many actuations does your canister show right now? Any hoarseness, white spots, or soreness when you rinse? And during soccer, roughly how many albuterol puffs per game?"

    "text": "My aunt says it only clicks at six sprays left, and, uh, I forgot to bring the spare because I thought the refill was automatic. I haven't had any sore throat or white patches, and I always gargle after, promise. In soccer I take two puffs right before the whistle and that\u2019s usually enough; I almost never need another one. If the orange inhaler empties before the 28th, can I skip a couple of days, or should we ask the pharmacy again?"
