  "Patient 11": "Ten-year-old Yusra, a recent refugee who speaks only Dari, comes with her aunt who interprets. She controls mild asthma with one puff of low-dose fluticasone twice daily and uses albuterol only during soccer. Because she has had no attacks in six months, we renewed the fluticasone without changes. She reports no drug allergies."
