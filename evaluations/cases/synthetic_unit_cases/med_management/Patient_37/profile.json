  "Patient 37": "Twelve-year-old Noah lives year-round on his parents\u2019 canal boat, limiting easy clinic visits. His asthma remains mild; we increased his inhaled fluticasone from one to two puffs nightly for better fall pollen control. He otherwise takes only a chewable multivitamin and has no known allergies."
