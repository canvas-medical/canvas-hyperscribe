[{"speaker":"Clinician","text":"So, Raúl, quick recap while the nurse finishes the paperwork: we gave you the first paliperidone shot in the left deltoid, 156 milligrams, fifteen-second push. It starts releasing within a day, so tonight you shouldn’t need the risperidone tablets anymore. Common snags are sleepy fog, stiff muscles, or a sore lump where we injected; rare but urgent would be high fever or neck stiffness—call us or 911 if that happens. I’m faxing a calendar to the shelter so they remember the day twenty-eight refills are due. Sound clear?"},{"speaker":"Patient","text":"Uh, I—I think so, but my bus for Tucson leaves in three weeks, and I don’t know where I’ll be sleeping down there. If I miss that next shot, the voices will come roaring back. Can they give it someplace else?"},{"speaker":"Clinician","text":"Good catch. The depot brand we used today is stocked at nearly every county clinic. I’ll ping the mobile outreach team in Pima County and pre-authorize a walk-in on day twenty-eight—give or take two days is still okay. Keep the little wallet card I’m printing; it has the lot number and dosing schedule. If the shelter mail loses it, snap a photo."},{"speaker":"Patient","text":"Okay, that helps. My arm already feels kind of hot and tight, though. Should I ice it or just, like, chew more gum and ignore it? And does the shot mess with smoking cravings?"},{"speaker":"Clinician","text":"A cold pack ten minutes on, ten off, for the first evening usually tames the swelling. Paliperidone doesn’t touch nicotine receptors, so the gum routine stays the same—park, chew, park."},{"speaker":"Clinician","text":"More important is hydration and salt balance; that lowers the risk of dizziness when you stand. You’ll get a brief prolactin check next visit, too—if your chest feels tender or you leak fluid, flag it early."},{"speaker":"Patient","text":"Got it. I’ve been drinking the shelter’s coffee instead of water—guess I’ll switch. Uh, one last thing: if the pharmacy van shows up while I’m at work program, can my buddy sign for the delivery?"}]
