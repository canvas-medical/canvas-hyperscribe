  "Patient 12": "Twenty-three-year-old Ra\u00fal currently sleeps at a downtown shelter and often misplaces his pill bottles. He had been taking risperidone tablets, but missed doses triggered fresh auditory hallucinations. Today we switched him to a monthly under-the-skin paliperidone depot and arranged pharmacy delivery to the shelter. He also chews nicotine gum and has no known allergies."
