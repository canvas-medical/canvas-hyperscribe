  "Patient 24": "Eleven-year-old Malik is staying at a downtown family shelter and keeps his inhaler in a shared locker. His only medicine is fluticasone inhaled twice daily for asthma, but he often forgets the evening dose. Today the dose was doubled to one stronger puff morning and night, and a spacer was provided to shorten administration time."
