Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,Reward for documenting that the previous fluticasone 110 mcg inhaler fell off formulary and was replaced with a 220 mcg per-actuation canister,20,30.0,6.0,Note lists new 220 mcg inhaler but does not mention that 110 mcg fell off formulary or that it is a replacement.
2,Reward for recording the new dosing instructions: one puff in the morning and one puff at night (no longer two puffs each time),10,40.0,4.0,"Narrative states 1 puff AM/PM, but the prescription SIG still says ""2 puffs twice daily,"" so dosing update is only partially correct."
3,"Reward for noting that a clear spacer was provided and for including the specific technique instructions (shake, attach, slow 4-second inhale, 5-second hold)",15,80.0,12.0,"Provides spacer instructions with shake, insert, 4-second inhale, 5-second hold, but does not specify that a clear spacer was handed out."
4,Reward for capturing the patient’s reported adherence barrier (locker line closes before lights-out leading to missed evening dose) and resulting nocturnal cough/chest tightness,10,95.0,9.5,HPI explicitly records locker-line barrier and associated nocturnal cough/chest tightness.
5,Reward for documenting the brainstormed and agreed plan to store the inhaler in the nurses’ cabinet until 10 p.m. with a clinician note (and mention of alternate phone alarm idea),10,70.0,7.0,Task describes storing inhaler in nurses’ cabinet until 10 p.m.; phone-alarm alternative not documented.
6,"Reward for including counseling about side effects: gargling/rinsing to avoid ‘frog throat’, reassurance about steroid dose and weight gain, monitoring for thrush",10,75.0,7.5,Includes gargle/rinse advice and mentions thrush/frog voice but omits reassurance about steroid dose & weight gain.
7,Reward for overall completeness: the note coherently summarizes all major exchange points from the encounter without omitting any of the above key items,10,65.0,6.5,"Captures most key elements, but omits formulary context, phone-alarm idea, weight-gain counseling, and has incorrect SIG."
8,"Penalize for failing to update the medication list and directions (e.g., leaving the outdated 110 mcg BID entry or omitting the new 220 mcg regimen)",15,30.0,-10.5,"Old 110 mcg med not shown, but new SIG is wrong; therefore medication directions not fully updated."
9,Penalize for introducing clinical details or recommendations not present in the transcript or chart,10,90.0,-1.0,No new clinical details beyond encounter content were introduced.
10,"Penalize for copying irrelevant or extraneous chart information unrelated to this visit (e.g., unrelated immunizations, family history not discussed)",5,95.0,-0.25,No irrelevant historical data copied into note.
