One tablet every day, no seven-day break, start tonight even though it\u2019s mid-cycle; the shift work won\u2019t hurt it as long as you anchor the dose to a single clock time\u2014set an alarm for, say, 5 p.m. before you leave for work."

    "text": "Side-effects can be mild nausea, spotting the first couple packs, or tender breasts; serious warnings would be sudden leg pain, chest pressure, or a bad migraine with vision changes\u2014if any of those hit, skip the next pill and call me. Because you smoke, even just a few a day, keep it under five and stay hydrated; the clot risk stays low at this dose but I still have to nag. We\u2019ll check in at three months."

    "text": "I guess that works, but, uh, my breaks move around a lot. What if I\u2019m on a call when the alarm rings? Like, is being an hour late a big deal? I don\u2019t want to mess up."

    "text": "Ideally you take it within the same two-hour window, but one pill up to twelve hours late still blocks pregnancy. If the delay stretches past twelve hours, take the forgotten tablet as soon as you remember, even if that means two in one go, and use condoms for the next week. To help you remember, stash the pack next to your headset and slide a sticky note over the day you swallowed. I\u2019ll push a new claim to insurance tomorrow."

    "text": "Okay, that makes sense. The generic is fine, but the pharmacy texted me about a thirty-dollar copay. I\u2019m paid weekly, so can I pick up just one pack at a time?"
