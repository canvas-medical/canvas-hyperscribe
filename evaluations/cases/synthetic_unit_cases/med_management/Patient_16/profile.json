  "Patient 16": "A 28-year-old call-center agent working night shifts asked for her first prescription for a combined estrogen\u2013progestin birth-control pill. She reports no chronic illnesses and only takes over-the-counter vitamin D gummies. Because she smokes fewer than five cigarettes a day, the clinician selected a low-dose formulation and scheduled a three-month follow-up."
