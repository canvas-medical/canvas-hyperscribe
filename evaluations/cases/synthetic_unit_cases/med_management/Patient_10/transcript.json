    "text": "Your serum levels last month came back smack in the mid-therapeutic range, so I don\u2019t want to drop the 400-mg injection yet. The drowsiness usually peaks the first 48 hours, then tapers. Try taking the shot right after school next month; that way the heaviest effect hits overnight. If you\u2019re still sleepy past Sunday, text the nurse line\u2014 we can add a morning 5-mg modafinil sample for a week while we reassess."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Modafinil sounds okay, but the foster mom says any new pills mean another permission form, and that drags. Plus the weight\u2014 I\u2019m up eight pounds since the first shot. Nobody told me I\u2019d need bigger jeans this fast."

    "text": "I hear you, and I\u2019m watching that curve. Aripiprazole is lighter on weight gain than risperidone, but puberty plus cafeteria pizza can add up. Let\u2019s get you a dietitian consult; we can bill it under the injection visit so no extra paperwork. Meanwhile, track sugary drinks in the Daylio app\u2014I need screenshots next appointment. If the scale keeps climbing more than two pounds a month, we\u2019ll switch to the 300-mg dose or consider once-daily cariprazine."

    "text": "Quick logistics: today is April fifth, so the next depot is due no later than May third\u2014 that\u2019s four weeks minus two days to give us clinic flexibility. I already sent a reminder to your phone and to the foster parent portal. If school changes again, bring the new address right away; the dose must stay within a five-day window or the medicine level dips and symptoms can spike back."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Fine, but the last appointment got moved and the Uber voucher expired. I can\u2019t keep missing chemistry just because rides fall through. If the timing\u2019s that strict, can you set it up at the school nurse\u2019s office instead? I need something that actually works with my day."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Clinician",
    "text": "I already called district health; their nurse can administer the depot, but we need a refrigerator log and a one-page standing order signed by me. I\u2019ll fax that today; you just have to show up with the vial in a cooler pack. I\u2019ll text the barcode for pickup so the pharmacy releases it to you without an adult present."

    "speaker": "Clinician",
    "text": "Side-effect watch: if sleepiness drags past day three, or if your pants jump another inch in the waist, message me through the portal; don\u2019t wait for the next visit. And remember, sudden restlessness\u2014like you can\u2019t sit still in class\u2014could be akathisia, not ADHD. That\u2019s treatable, but only if I hear about it early. A brisk walk after lunch can blunt it too."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Okay, but akathisia sounds exactly like me after two energy drinks, so how am I supposed to tell the difference? And will any of this show up on that random drug screen the new principal keeps threatening us with?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Clinician",
    "text": "Good questions. Akathisia feels internal\u2014like your muscles are screaming to move\u2014even when caffeine wears off; write down when it hits and how long. As for drug tests, aripiprazole isn\u2019t a controlled substance and won\u2019t flag positive. If the screen uses a broad immunoassay, it could rarely cross-react, but I\u2019ll issue a letter stating the prescription so you\u2019re covered."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Letter\u2019s good. Just email it, because printers in the group home are always broken. One more thing: does the vitamin D do anything to help the meds, or is it just there so my bloodwork looks nice?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "And, uh, if the school nurse can\u2019t keep the vial cold, can I stash it in my locker with an ice pack, or will that wreck the shot? I don\u2019t want to mess this up."
