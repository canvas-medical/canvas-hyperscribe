  "Patient 10": "Fifteen-year-old Jalen, currently in foster care and switching schools frequently, was hospitalized last year for early-onset schizophrenia. Oral risperidone was hard to remember, so today he received his fourth monthly aripiprazole long-acting injection at the clinic. His only other medicine is vitamin D chewables. Caregivers were taught to watch for excessive sleepiness and sudden weight gain."
