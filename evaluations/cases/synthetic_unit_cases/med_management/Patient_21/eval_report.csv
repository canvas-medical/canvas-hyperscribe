Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,"Reward for clearly documenting the patient's chief complaint of sudden purple bruises on the arm and her worry that medication timing or dosing errors (aspirin doubling, skipped folic acid, methotrexate taken Wednesday instead of Tuesday) may be the cause.",15,80.0,12.0,Chief complaint of sudden purple arm bruises and worry about medication timing is clearly stated in HPI.

3,Reward for documenting the instruction that the next adalimumab injection is due Friday before lunch and should not be taken on the same day as methotrexate.,8,0.0,0.0,No mention of adalimumab timing or instruction not to take it on methotrexate day.
4,"Reward for accurately recording the new prednisone taper plan: start 10 mg tomorrow, then decrease by 1 mg every 5 days.",15,0.0,0.0,"Prednisone taper (10 mg start, ↓1 mg q5 days) not documented."
5,Reward for noting the clinician's monitoring and safety instructions: photograph and call same day if any bruise exceeds a quarter in size or feels warm.,8,90.0,7.2,Included precise monitoring instruction to photograph and call if bruise > quarter or warm.
6,"Reward for including the advice to keep a blood-pressure log because prednisone can elevate readings, and that amlodipine 5 mg nightly remains unchanged.",8,60.0,4.8,"Advice to keep blood-pressure log present, but amlodipine unchanged statement missing."
7,"Reward for documenting the task sent to the visiting nurse to recolor the pill organizer (blue for steroids, yellow for methotrexate).",6,100.0,6.0,Task sent to visiting nurse to recolor pill organizer exactly as specified.

9,"Reward for overall completeness: the note captures virtually all clinically pertinent information, decisions, instructions, and patient concerns expressed in the transcript.",15,20.0,3.0,"Several key decisions and instructions are missing, so overall completeness is poor."
