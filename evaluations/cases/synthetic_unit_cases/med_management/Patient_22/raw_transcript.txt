    "text": "Okay, deep breath, Kayla. Missing two active pills and then doubling causes the spotting; it’s nuisance, not muscle-killer. From tonight, take one blue tablet at 9 p.m., no doses. Because you skipped more than 48 hours, add condoms for seven days. If any pill is over 24 hours late, swallow it immediately, continue the pack, and restart seven-day condom clock. Expected side effects include breast tenderness, mild water weight, mood flutter—settle by the second pack and don’t hurt VO₂ max. But calf pain or sudden chest tightness means ER, no apologies. Tie the pill to tooth-brushing, set two alarms, and keep a backup strip in your gear bag."
