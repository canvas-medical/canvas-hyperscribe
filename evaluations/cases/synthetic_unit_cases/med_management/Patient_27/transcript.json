    "text": "No worries, missing tablets happens. Today\u2019s injection was 25 mg risperidone-er, slow release in the deltoid. It covers you for four weeks, so no tablets unless I message otherwise. Melatonin two gummies equals 10 mg; that\u2019s still safe, just keep it at one gummy\u20145 mg\u2014because higher doses can blur your daytime focus. Brand change: white generic is fine; same 2-mg strength. It dissolves the same. If the bottle predates today, recycle it so you don\u2019t double medicate. Labs: Tuesday the 14th, anytime before 3 p.m.\u2014we\u2019ll check prolactin, kidney, and liver panels. Set two phone alarms and ask Disability Services for a visual reminder board. Sound okay?"
