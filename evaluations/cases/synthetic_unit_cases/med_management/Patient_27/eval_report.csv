1,"Reward for clearly documenting today's administration of risperidone-ER 25 mg intramuscular injection to the deltoid, including that it provides four-week coverage.",15,85.0,12.75,"Includes “Risperidone 25 mg intramuscular suspension, extended release, administered today, covering for four weeks,” but does not specify deltoid site."
2,Reward for noting the clinician’s explicit instruction that the patient should take NO oral risperidone tablets during the next four weeks unless otherwise messaged.,10,90.0,9.0,"Explicitly states “No tablets unless otherwise instructed,” matching clinician’s directive."

4,"Reward for recording the melatonin discussion: accidental 10 mg (two gummies), clinician statement that this is safe, and guidance to limit future dosing to one 5 mg gummy to avoid daytime grogginess.",10,50.0,5.0,"Gives guidance to limit melatonin to one 5-mg gummy, yet omits the accidental 10-mg ingestion and clinician assurance of safety/daytime grogginess comment."
5,"Reward for documenting the ordered labs (prolactin, kidney, liver panels) with the specific date and timing window: Tuesday the 14th before 3 p.m.",12,95.0,11.4,"Orders prolactin, kidney, liver labs for Tuesday the 14th before 3 p.m.; fully matches detail requested."

7,Reward for reflecting the patient’s reported sleep disturbance despite melatonin in the history of present illness.,5,0.0,0.0,Note contains no statement about ongoing sleep disturbance despite melatonin.
8,Reward for overall completeness and accuracy: the note faithfully summarizes all clinically relevant statements and instructions from the transcript without omission or distortion.,20,60.0,12.0,"Captures most key items but misses several details (missed doses, color confusion, melatonin overdose context, sleep complaint)."
9,"Penalize for adding, altering, or omitting substantive information (e.g., different doses, additional medications, diagnoses, or plans) that was not stated or implied in the transcript.",10,90.0,-1.0,Does not introduce incorrect doses/meds; minor neutral additions (ICD code) acceptable.
