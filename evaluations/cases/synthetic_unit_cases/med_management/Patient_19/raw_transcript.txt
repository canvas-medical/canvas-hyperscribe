  {"speaker": "Clinician", "text": "Marcus, your aripiprazole shot is due Friday; the log shows only four buprenorphine–naloxone strips left. Any missed doses since switching?"},
  {"speaker": "Patient", "text": "Uh, I, I think I took them each morning, but yesterday I dropped the pack between the seats, so I'm not totally sure I swallowed one."},
  {"speaker": "Clinician", "text": "Okay, no shame, it happens. Any sweats, yawning, or muscle cramps hinting at withdrawal after that maybe-missed dose?"},
  {"speaker": "Patient", "text": "I felt kinda restless last night, kept tapping the steering wheel, but, uh, no chills or goosebumps. I figured it was the cold air outside."},
  {"speaker": "Patient", "text": "My arm from the last shot’s still a little sore, like a lump when I lean back. That normal, right?"},
  {"speaker": "Patient", "text": "Also I’m parking by the river now, and the thermometer on the dash says thirty-two at night. Does that mess much with the blister packs?"},
  {"speaker": "Patient", "text": "Sometimes the films taste extra bitter. Not always, just sometimes. Is that the naloxone, or maybe they went bad from the cold out there overnight?"},
  {"speaker": "Patient", "text": "And, uh, the pharmacy said I’m at my limit till next week. Do I just wait or get samples somewhere?"},
  {"speaker": "Patient", "text": "Case worker mentioned a lockbox, but no one’s called. Should I keep asking them yet?"},
  {"speaker": "Clinician", "text": "Yes—freeze under 15°F hurts the films, but thirty-two is okay. Keep them tucked inside your jacket pocket overnight."},
  {"speaker": "Clinician", "text": "That knot at the shot site is normal; massage or warm compress will ease it."},
  {"speaker": "Clinician", "text": "I’ll issue an emergency five-day card, and nudge the lockbox team this afternoon for you."}
