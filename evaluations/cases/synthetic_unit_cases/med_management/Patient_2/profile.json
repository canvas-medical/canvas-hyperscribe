  "Patient 2": "Twenty-four-year-old Maya, an uninsured barista planning a backpacking trip abroad, requests a single renewal of sertraline 50 mg by mouth each morning for anxiety. No dose change is needed because symptoms are controlled and she reports no side effects. At the same visit she starts a daily levonorgestrel-ethinyl-estradiol pill for reliable contraception. She is allergic to sulfa antibiotics."
