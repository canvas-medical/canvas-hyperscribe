Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,"Reward for accurately documenting the antiviral regimen: three tablets of glecaprevir–pibrentasvir taken with a snack within one hour after dialysis, and noting the clinician's explanation that the drug is hepatically cleared and not removed by dialysis.",15,70.0,10.5,"Regimen includes 3 tablets with snack within 1h after dialysis, but omits note that drug is hepatically cleared and not removed by dialysis."
2,"Reward for capturing all laboratory orders exactly as stated: week-4 trough HCV RNA, routine CMP, and tacrolimus level via the automatic lab bundle.",8,90.0,7.2,"Lists week-4 trough HCV RNA, routine CMP, and tacrolimus level; bundle terminology not mentioned but orders correct."
3,"Reward for recording the carvedilol interaction override, including baseline QTc 420 ms, cardiology’s 30 ms delta threshold, immediate 7-day pharmacy release, and plan to extend to a full-month supply after follow-up labs.",10,40.0,4.0,"Mentions override and 7-day release, but lacks baseline QTc 420 ms, 30 ms delta threshold, and plan for full-month refill."
4,"Reward for documenting the QT monitoring plan: EKG at week one and weekly thereafter if QT prolongs, with results routed to the patient portal.",10,80.0,8.0,EKG at week one and weekly if QT prolongs documented; routing of results to portal absent.
5,"Reward for including the pruritus management strategy: continue nightly emollient, add cool compresses post-dialysis, advise messaging if severity >5/10, and contingency options of hydroxyzine 10 mg HS (renal-adjusted) or rifampin after week-2 labs before steroid creams.",10,40.0,4.0,"Continues emollient and adds cool compresses; misses >5/10 messaging instruction and contingency meds (hydroxyzine, rifampin)."
6,"Reward for noting home-monitoring instructions: maintain HR >60 bpm and SBP >90 mmHg, keep a BP/dizziness log, and bring it to the Tuesday session.",6,95.0,5.7,"HR>60, SBP>90, keep BP/dizziness log, bring Tuesday documented fully."
7,"Reward for capturing the patient’s expressed concerns (dialysis efficacy on drug levels, carvedilol delay, QT follow-up clarity, persistent itching) as part of the history or counseling sections.",6,75.0,4.5,"Captures concerns about antiviral timing, carvedilol delay, QT monitoring; itching concern partially implied but not explicitly listed."
8,"Reward for overall completeness: the note reflects all major decisions, instructions, and patient concerns from the transcript without significant omissions or distortions.",20,70.0,14.0,"Note covers most key decisions but misses several specific details (hepatic clearance, QTc values, portal routing, pruritus contingencies)."
9,"Penalize for fabricating, altering, or omitting clinical details not supported by the transcript or chart (e.g., changing dosages, adding diagnoses, or inventing lab results).",20,90.0,-2.0,No fabricated or altered clinical data detected; only omissions.
10,"Penalize for indiscriminate or irrelevant copying from the chart (e.g., listing unrelated conditions or medications that were not discussed in the encounter).",8,95.0,-0.4,No irrelevant chart copy; content focused on encounter.
