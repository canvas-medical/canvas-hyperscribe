  "Patient 5": "A 62-year-old man on thrice-weekly dialysis for end-stage kidney disease was started today on glecaprevir-pibrentasvir to treat chronic hepatitis C. His list already includes carvedilol, sevelamer, and nightly pruritus lotion. Because the antiviral can raise tacrolimus levels and prolong QT, close lab checks and an updated cardiology note were ordered. He denies drug allergies."
