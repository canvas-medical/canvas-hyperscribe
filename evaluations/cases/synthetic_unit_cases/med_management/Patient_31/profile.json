  "Patient 31": "Seventeen-year-old Alex is living with his grandparents while both parents serve overseas. He only takes a once-daily 10-milligram loratadine tablet to keep spring allergies from flaring during soccer season. Today he asked for a one-year refill so he can keep pills in his locker. He reports no other medicines or allergies."
