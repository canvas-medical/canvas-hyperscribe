  "Patient 33": "Eighty-year-old Mr. Coltrane, a retired jazz saxophonist with mild hearing loss, juggles seven daily medicines. Glyburide was discontinued last month, and a weekly semaglutide pen was started to improve diabetes control without low-sugar spells. He also takes low-dose aspirin, atorvastatin, lisinopril, and eye drops for glaucoma. He avoids sulfa antibiotics after a rash years ago."
