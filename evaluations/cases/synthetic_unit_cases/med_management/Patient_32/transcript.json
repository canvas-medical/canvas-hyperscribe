Amal\u2019s on the standard Crohn\u2019s dosing: adalimumab 40 milligrams every 14 days, next shot this Sunday, thigh or belly, leave it at room temp 20 minutes, inject at 90 degrees, hold ten seconds, then drop it in the sharps. Current literature, over ten thousand pregnancies, shows no spike in malformations or infections, so we are not pausing it. Prenatal vitamin stays one tablet breakfast, ideally with food to curb nausea."

Blood pressure\u2014since lisinopril is out, we\u2019ll confirm readings today; if two home logs top 140/90 we\u2019ll start labetalol 100 mg twice daily while clearing it with OB."

Also, my cuff keeps reading 145 over 92 even when I\u2019m resting, and I\u2019m getting pounding headaches. Plus FedEx just delayed the next pen three days; what if I miss Sunday? Will my intestines flare again and hurt the baby?"
