  "Patient 32": "Thirty-four-year-old Amal, pregnant at 24 weeks and speaking through a phone interpreter, self-injects adalimumab every two weeks for Crohn\u2019s disease. The team reviewed that the biologic is considered safe and renewed the supply. Her prenatal vitamin continues, and lisinopril for mild hypertension was stopped once pregnancy was confirmed. No drug allergies were reported."
