Amal’s on the standard Crohn’s dosing: adalimumab 40 milligrams every 14 days, next shot this Sunday, thigh or belly, leave it at room temp 20 minutes, inject at 90 degrees, hold ten seconds, then drop it in the sharps. Current literature, over ten thousand pregnancies, shows no spike in malformations or infections, so we are not pausing it. Prenatal vitamin stays one tablet breakfast, ideally with food to curb nausea."},{"speaker":"Clinician","text":"Side-effect checklist: redness or bruising bigger than a quarter at the site, fever above 100.4, or any sudden abdominal pain—call us first, don’t just skip.

Also, my cuff keeps reading 145 over 92 even when I’m resting, and I’m getting pounding headaches. Plus FedEx just delayed the next pen three days; what if I miss Sunday? Will my intestines flare again and hurt the baby?"}]
