2,Reward for capturing the plan to shift furosemide 20 mg administration from noon to 10 a.m. with stated goal of reducing evening dizziness and allowing lunchtime re-hydration.,12,0.0,0.0,No mention of moving furosemide dose to 10 a.m. or stated goals.
3,"Reward for recording the patient’s reported night-time dizziness, ringing in ears, emotional distress, and her desire to keep the ""water pill"" so her shoes fit.",10,40.0,4.0,Includes dizziness and ringing in ears but omits emotional distress reference to shoes/water pill.
4,Reward for documenting clinician orders for baseline ECG and serum electrolytes.,10,100.0,10.0,“Ordered baseline ECG and electrolytes” captured verbatim.
5,Reward for including the conditional plan to start potassium chloride 20 mEq after supper daily if potassium drops below 4 mEq/L.,8,100.0,8.0,Conditional KCl 20 mEq after supper if K<4 mEq/L documented exactly.
6,"Reward for noting clinician instructions to aides: stand-by assist for ambulation, slow position changes, and daily blood-pressure recording in the binder.",8,95.0,7.6,"Instructions to aides about stand-by assist, slow position changes, and daily BP recording all present."
7,Reward for recording that the next risperidone injection is due on day 28 and that excessive daytime drowsiness (>2 naps) should trigger a call to reduce the dose to 12.5 mg.,8,100.0,8.0,States next injection day 28 and dose reduction trigger if >2 naps.
8,"Reward for documenting the patient’s continued hallucinations, her request to advance the injection, and the clinician’s explanation for holding until steady state after two injections.",10,30.0,3.0,Notes ongoing hallucinations but lacks patient’s request to advance injection and clinician explanation.
9,"Reward for capturing the patient’s QT-interval concern about combining the water pill with risperidone and the clinician’s response (low risk, daily pulse checks, weekly ECG for one month).",10,70.0,7.0,Records QT concern and plan for daily pulse checks & weekly ECG; omits reassurance of low risk.
10,Reward for noting that the grandson served as interpreter and the facility nurse signed as witness.,5,0.0,0.0,No documentation of grandson interpreter or nurse witness.
11,"Reward for accurately listing ongoing medications and their typical timing (furosemide, aspirin 81 mg with supper, vitamin D after breakfast) without adding drugs not mentioned.",6,0.0,0.0,Medication list with timing not included at all.
12,"Reward for overall completeness: the note captures all major statements, decisions, and patient concerns from the encounter without significant omissions or distortions.",20,50.0,10.0,"Major decisions captured, but several key elements (furosemide change, interpreter, med list) missing."
13,"Penalize for omitting or inaccurately transcribing any high-value element above (e.g., wrong dose, missing ECG order, mis-timed medications).",20,30.0,-14.0,Multiple high-value omissions lowering fidelity.
14,"Penalize for introducing new clinical content, recommendations, or assessments that were not explicitly stated or implied in the transcript or chart.",15,90.0,-1.5,No new unsupported clinical content added.
15,"Penalize for copying irrelevant or excessive chart details (unrelated past history, medications, or demographic data) that were not referenced during the encounter.",10,95.0,-0.5,Does not add irrelevant chart history or meds.
16,"Penalize for fabricating patient responses or clinician statements not present in the transcript (e.g., denying side effects that were never addressed).",10,85.0,-1.5,No obvious fabricated patient or clinician statements detected.
