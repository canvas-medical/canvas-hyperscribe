  "Patient 9": "Sixty-three-year-old Malik, who still flies overseas for consulting work, carries a long list of medicines: dolutegravir and lamivudine for human immunodeficiency virus, amlodipine, low-dose aspirin, and omeprazole. Last week oncology began cabozantinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor for renal cancer. Because cabozantinib and dolutegravir both raise QT risk, he received instructions on keeping electrolytes normal and arranging monthly electrocardiograms. No drug allergies."
