You\u2019re still on dolutegravir-lamivudine 50/300 mg once daily in the morning, correct? Cabozantinib is 60 mg at night with food spaced at least two hours from the antacid. That keeps the tiny pH effect from omeprazole from blunting absorption. Because both agents can nudge the QT interval, the critical thing is stable potassium and magnesium: target potassium above 4.0, magnesium above 2.0. I\u2019m prescribing 400 mg magnesium glycinate at bedtime; no laxative surprise. We\u2019ll grab baseline labs today\u2014potassium, mag, creatinine\u2014one quick tube, in and out. In flight, keep the pills on home-time; if a leg crosses midnight, just keep the twelve-hour gap. Side-effect watch list: jaw pain, hand-foot redness, mouth sores, or any flutter in the chest\u2014call before your next dose. Last, the ECG: cardiology has you for the first Thursday of each month, five minutes, in and out. Does that, uh, all line up so far?"

I took my first cabozantinib last night, exactly two hours after dinner, yet this morning I felt a weird skip in my heartbeat. My phone ECG strip said 105 milliseconds QTc, or maybe I read it wrong\u2014either way, it scared me. Also, the supplement aisle has ten kinds of magnesium; if I grab citrate instead of glycinate will you later say I botched the absorption? And aspirin: the oncologist\u2019s nurse muttered something about bleeding risk, but nobody told me to stop, so I\u2019m still on 81 milligrams. Finally, if customs confiscates the pills, do I just miss doses until I\u2019m back, or do I beg a local doctor? I need straight answers, not shrugs."
