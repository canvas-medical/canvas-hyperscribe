Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,Reward for accurately documenting the patient's reported calf soreness and dark urine occurring after the second atovaquone–proguanil dose,10,95.0,9.5,"HPI explicitly states ""calf soreness and dark urine after the second dose of atovaquone-proguanil."""
2,Reward for capturing the clinician's expressed concern about statin-related myopathy/rhabdomyolysis (versus simple dehydration) as the working assessment,8,85.0,6.8,Note mentions concern for myopathy/rhabdomyolysis from atorvastatin but does not contrast with dehydration.
3,"Reward for recording the explicit instruction to stop atorvastatin immediately and keep it off until 48 hours after any last nirmatrelvir–ritonavir dose, including the rationale about ritonavir raising statin levels",15,70.0,10.5,"Captures instruction to stop atorvastatin and cites ritonavir risk, but omits the ""48 h after last dose"" timeframe."
4,Reward for noting that the patient should continue the malaria prophylaxis (atovaquone–proguanil),5,95.0,4.75,Explicitly instructs patient to continue atovaquone-proguanil.
5,Reward for documenting the hydration directive of approximately three liters of water daily,5,95.0,4.75,"States ""double water intake to about three liters daily,"" matching directive."
6,Reward for including the instruction to log muscle weakness or cola-colored urine and for the field nurse to transmit daily vitals,5,60.0,3.0,Includes logging muscle weakness/cola-colored urine but misses directive for field nurse daily vitals.
7,"Reward for capturing the emailed algorithm thresholds and actions: pain >5/10 or brown urine >6 h → hold suspect meds, start oral rehydration salts, radio river post for evacuation",10,95.0,9.5,"Verbatim records threshold algorithm: pain >5/10 or brown urine >6 h, hold meds, start ORS, contact river post."
8,Reward for documenting continued grapefruit avoidance with explanation and recommendation to choose oranges or safe bottled juice,5,95.0,4.75,Notes grapefruit avoidance with explanation and alternative juices.
9,"Reward for recording albuterol handling (zip bag with silica gel), dosage (two puffs if wheeze), and usage threshold (more than twice a week → notify mission doctor for reassessment)",5,95.0,4.75,"Details storage (zip bag, silica gel), dose (two puffs if wheeze), and >2/week notification trigger."
10,"Reward for listing only relevant current medications from the chart (atorvastatin, atovaquone–proguanil, albuterol, hydrochlorothiazide) without adding unrelated chart data",5,70.0,3.5,"References only relevant meds but omits hydrochlorothiazide, so med list not fully complete."
11,"Reward for overall completeness: the note mirrors the full set of instructions, assessments, and contextual details presented in the transcript without significant omissions or sequencing distortions",10,80.0,8.0,"Captures almost all instructions; minor omissions (48 h statin window, daily vitals, HCTZ mention)."
12,"Penalize for introducing fabricated clinical details (e.g., vitals, new diagnoses, lab orders) that are not present in either the transcript or chart",10,98.0,-0.2,"No fabricated vitals, labs, or new diagnoses introduced."
13,"Penalize for omitting any major plan element such as stopping atorvastatin, hydration goals, algorithm thresholds, or albuterol usage guidance",15,90.0,-1.5,Major plan elements present; only minor timing/vitals details missing.
14,"Penalize for copying irrelevant or broad chart information (e.g., unrelated past surgeries, family history, exhaustive medication codes) that was not referenced in the encounter",7,100.0,-0.0,Does not copy irrelevant chart data or history.
