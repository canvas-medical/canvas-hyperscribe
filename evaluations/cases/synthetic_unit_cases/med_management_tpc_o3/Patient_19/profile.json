  "Patient 19": "Thirty-eight-year-old Marcus, an Army veteran presently sleeping in his car, carries a diagnosis of schizophrenia and opioid use disorder. He receives monthly aripiprazole injection at the drop-in clinic and takes buprenorphine\u2013naloxone films by mouth each morning. After losing his pill organizer, staff switched the films to a once-daily blister pack and documented his severe sulfa allergy. Case workers are arranging medication lockboxes."
