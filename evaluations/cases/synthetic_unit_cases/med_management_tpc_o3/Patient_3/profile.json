  "Patient 3": "A 35-year-old expectant mother who speaks primarily Mandarin uses an interpreter at every visit. She has Crohn\u2019s disease and continues adalimumab injections every other week, which her obstetrician cleared after reviewing safety data. Prenatal vitamins, low-dose aspirin, and ondansetron as needed round out her list. We provided pictorial instructions to avoid misunderstandings about injection sites."
