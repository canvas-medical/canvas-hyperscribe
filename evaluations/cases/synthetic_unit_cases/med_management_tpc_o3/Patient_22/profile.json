  "Patient 22": "Twenty-two-year-old track runner Kayla, covered by campus insurance, requested her first birth-control pill before summer training. She takes no other medication and has no known allergies. The clinician started a combined ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel tablet once daily and set a three-month follow-up to check side effects and blood-pressure readings."
