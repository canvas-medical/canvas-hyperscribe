    "text": "Right after dialysis is actually ideal—the drug is hepatically cleared, not dialyzable, so plasma levels stay stable. Take all three tablets with a snack within one hour of ending your run. I'll order a trough HCV RNA at week four and routine CMP, plus tacrolimus level even though you're not currently on it; lab bundle prints automatically for the nurse."

    "text": "As for carvedilol, the interaction flag is pharmacokinetic but clinically minor. I just submitted an override note citing your baseline ECG, which shows 420-millisecond QT; cardiology agreed the delta to watch is 30 ms. Pharmacy should release a seven-day fill today; I'll push for a full month once the first follow-up labs confirm safety, again."

    "text": "For the itching, keep using the emollient nightly and add cool compresses post-dialysis. If pruritus escalates beyond a five on your zero-to-ten scale, message me—we can trial hydroxyzine 10 mg at bedtime, renal-adjusted, or consider rifampin after we rule out drug-induced liver injury at week two labs before touching steroid creams."

    "text": "Last piece—monitor vitals at home: heart rate over 60, systolic above 90. Bring the BP log and any dizziness notes to Tuesday’s session. I’ll set the EKG for week one, then weekly if QT creeps; results feed straight into your portal within hours for review."
