The paper says nausea and maybe weight loss, yet I can’t afford to be dizzy on the tractor. Driving two hours for a needle each month is fine, but if the fridge fails again I’ll lose the pen and the insulin together. And with glyburide gone, what if my after-lunch numbers spike while I’m out in the south field? I need something practical, not fancy clinic talk—just tell me, plain, how to keep everything straight when the days get really long and hot."
