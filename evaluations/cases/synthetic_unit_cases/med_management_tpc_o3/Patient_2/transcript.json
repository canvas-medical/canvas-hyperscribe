The paper says nausea and maybe weight loss, yet I can\u2019t afford to be dizzy on the tractor. Driving two hours for a needle each month is fine, but if the fridge fails again I\u2019ll lose the pen and the insulin together. And with glyburide gone, what if my after-lunch numbers spike while I\u2019m out in the south field? I need something practical, not fancy clinic talk\u2014just tell me, plain, how to keep everything straight when the days get really long and hot."
