  "Patient 29": "Sixty-eight-year-old Helena migrates seasonally between Michigan and Arizona, complicating medication shipping. Her lung cancer therapy, the oral tyrosine-kinase inhibitor osimertinib, was lowered to 40 mg daily after a borderline QT interval. She also takes aspirin and atorvastatin. The pharmacy arranged mail-order refills and travel electrocardiograms at each snowbird location."
