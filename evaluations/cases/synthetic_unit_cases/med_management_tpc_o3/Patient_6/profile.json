  "Patient 6": "Between shifts at a downtown caf\u00e9, 26-year-old Camila, currently uninsured, visited for worsening menstrual cramps and irregular bleeding. She takes only over-the-counter ibuprofen and has no allergies. Today she received her first prescription for a low-dose combined estrogen-progestin pill, taken once daily by mouth. Follow-up focuses on adherence and securing affordable refills."
