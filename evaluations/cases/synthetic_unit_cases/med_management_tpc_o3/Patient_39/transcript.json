Since restarting the bictegravir-emtricitabine-tenofovir, I\u2019ve hit my 8 a.m. alarm every day, but, uh, yesterday I sneezed right after swallowing and wasn\u2019t sure the tablet stayed down, so I took a second one ten minutes later. Did I just double-dose myself?"

My chest burns if I skip it, but I really don\u2019t want to weaken the HIV drug again. Should I slide the omeprazole to dinner, switch to famotidine, or just grit my teeth for now?"

Do I start hunting random coupons online, or is there some sample stash here that could tide me over so my pressure doesn\u2019t spike?"
