  "Patient 39": "Forty-six-year-old Darren, recently laid off and without insurance, returned after a month\u2019s lapse in his human immunodeficiency virus pills. We restarted bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir once daily and arranged drug-assistance enrollment. He still takes amlodipine for blood pressure and a nightly heartburn tablet. A phone reminder system was set up to reduce missed doses."
