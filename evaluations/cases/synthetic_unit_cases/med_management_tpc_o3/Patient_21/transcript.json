    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "She kept asking if I doubled the aspirin or skipped the folic acid, and I got flustered, because, well, the pill box was kind of mixed up after my granddaughter visited last weekend, and all."

    "text": "Honestly, the methotrexate day is Tuesdays, right, but with the holiday I took it Wednesday evening instead, and now I\u2019m panicking that the timing with the new prednisone schedule is wrong and that\u2019s why the bruises exploded all over me in just one weird night."

    "speaker": "Clinician",
    "text": "It\u2019s okay, really, I\u2019m glad you flagged it, because bruising can show up even when you do everything right. The side-effect alert just popped on my screen too, so let\u2019s walk through the timing together."

    "speaker": "Clinician",
    "text": "First, aspirin stays at 81 milligrams each breakfast, no doubling. Methotrexate is ten milligrams once weekly, preferably Tuesday morning with water, and folic acid one milligram every single day still."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Alright, but I, um, sometimes wake up late and the Tuesday pill ends up closer to noon than breakfast. Does that wreck the spacing? And if my hand hurts that morning, could I still take an extra Tylenol for pain."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Clinician",
    "text": "Your next adalimumab injection lands this Friday; take it before lunch, not the same day as methotrexate. That spacing cuts the bruise risk a bit."

    "speaker": "Clinician",
    "text": "Prednisone starts at ten milligrams tomorrow, then drop by one milligram every five days\u2014slow and steady to give your skin."

    "speaker": "Clinician",
    "text": "I\u2019ve messaged the nurse to update the pill organizer colors: blue for steroids, yellow for methotrexate, easy visual cue too."

    "text": "If a bruise gets larger than a quarter or feels warm, snap a photo and call me the same day."

    "speaker": "Clinician",
    "text": "Meanwhile, keep the blood pressure log, because prednisone can nudge numbers up; amlodipine stays five milligrams nightly just like before."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "And, uh, the taper chart\u2014could you print it big? My reading glasses are useless at night, and I\u2019d rather tape the schedule right on the fridge for quick double checks."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I also found an old bottle of 5-milligram prednisone from last winter. Should I toss it, or can we use those for the smaller steps instead of cutting the big tablets? They crumble so easily."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "One more thing\u2014I\u2019m embarrassed to ask, but if the bruises keep showing, my bridge group will notice. Is it okay to dab a little cover-up makeup, or will that irritate the skin too much maybe."
