  "Patient 18": "Fifty-four-year-old Marie, who speaks primarily Haitian Creole, manages type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and chronic knee pain. She currently takes metformin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and naproxen, and has a penicillin rash allergy. Because her weight has climbed, the team added weekly semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist, and explained injection technique using interpreter cards. Blood-sugar logs will be reviewed in six weeks."
