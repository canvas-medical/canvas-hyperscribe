We\u2019ve bumped your fluticasone from 110 micrograms to 220 micrograms, still two puffs in the morning and two at night, and we\u2019re arranging the voucher so you can pick it up tomorrow. Side-effect watch list: hoarseness, white patches, sore throat\u2014if any of those pop up, rinse and spit after every dose and call us. Keep the albuterol on you, four-to-six puffs max in 24 hours. Sound doable?"

    "text": "Yeah, I guess, but I\u2019ve tried upping meds before and it didn\u2019t really change the coughing at night, so what if this stronger inhaler also, uh, just does nothing? Mom\u2019s already stressed about getting to the clinic before it closes, and my flight\u2019s Sunday dawn. I can\u2019t afford a bad flare mid-trip."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I\u2019m still using the spacer like you showed me, and I rinse sometimes, but, honestly, when I\u2019m half-asleep I forget. Could that be why my throat feels scratchy? Also, the albuterol runs out fast\u2014eight puffs last night alone\u2014so I\u2019m worried the stronger steroid isn\u2019t enough."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "And what about the plane air? My cousin says bring a nebulizer, but that seems overkill\u2014do I just rely on puffs?"
