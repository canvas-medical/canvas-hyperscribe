  "Patient 17": "Sixteen-year-old Bryce lives on a remote reservation and rides the community bus two hours for asthma visits. He has used budesonide inhaled steroid twice-daily since age nine. Today the dose was nudged up from 200 to 400 micrograms because spring smoke worsened his wheeze. No drug allergies are reported."
