You’re still on 300 mg twice daily, empty stomach—no food two hours before, one hour after, correct? Any palpitations, faint spells, or new cramps since the last ECG? Also, please remind me: did you completely stop the dextromethorphan syrup, and have you skipped any lisinopril or simvastatin doses?"

    "text": "But the urgent-care clinic cancelled next week’s ECG because insurance won't pay their technician overtime. If I skip a month, is that dangerous?"

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Also, online forums warn me simvastatin could raise nilotinib levels. Should I cut the statin dose, or switch to something else before the next refill?"
  },

    "speaker": "Clinician",
    "text": "Hold the statin tonight; I’ll fax a switch to pravastatin 40 mg. I’ll reroute the ECG to Monday morning here in oncology—no delay. Insurance appeal file opened."
