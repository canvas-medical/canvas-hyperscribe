  "Patient 26": "Ten-year-old Niko lives in a coastal Alaskan village reachable only by floatplane. His sole medicine, a budesonide-formoterol inhaler, was renewed today; dose remains two puffs morning and night for mild asthma. No allergies or other illnesses. The school nurse will log usage while winter ice keeps him far from pharmacies."
