  "Patient 7": "Seventy-five-year-old Mr. Ruiz lives alone in a lakeside cabin and relies on mail-order medicines because winter roads often close. His only prescription is levothyroxine. After a recent lab showed slightly low thyroid-stimulating hormone, the tablet strength was decreased from 100 to 88 micrograms each morning. No medication allergies are documented."
