Swallow one every day with the first snack after your night shift, no breaks, start tonight even if bleeding. Set an alarm so nothing slips."

I\u2019ve already fired off an electronic appeal; if they still stonewall, I\u2019ll switch to the $12 generic at Costco so your out-of-pocket stays predictable. Either way, don\u2019t stretch or split packs\u2014steady daily dosing is what tames the bleeding and eases those cramps."

Alarming would be sharp calf pain or crushing chest pressure; that means ER, then call me. Keep a backup pad handy; if flow is still soaking through hourly by week eight, ping the portal right away."

    "speaker": "Clinician",
    "text": "Totally unrelated, promise. Penicillin rash is immune, clots are hormone and genetic. For timing, one pill within a three-hour window is fine; if you overshoot, take one immediately\u2014never double doses."
