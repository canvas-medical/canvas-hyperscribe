  "Patient 1": "A 24-year-old graduate student preparing for a semester in Ghana has no chronic conditions and reports a shellfish allergy. Today she received her first prescription for daily atovaquone-proguanil tablets to begin two days before departure and continue one week after return. No other medicines are taken, so adherence counseling focused on timing with meals.",
  "Patient 2": "An 78-year-old farmer living two hours from the nearest clinic manages diabetes, heart failure, and arthritis. His current list tops eleven drugs, including insulin glargine at night and the new weekly semaglutide injection started today to help with weight and sugar swings. We agreed to stop glyburide to cut hypoglycemia risk, and a telephone refill plan was arranged.",
  "Patient 3": "A 35-year-old expectant mother who speaks primarily Mandarin uses an interpreter at every visit. She has Crohn\u2019s disease and continues adalimumab injections every other week, which her obstetrician cleared after reviewing safety data. Prenatal vitamins, low-dose aspirin, and ondansetron as needed round out her list. We provided pictorial instructions to avoid misunderstandings about injection sites.",
  "Patient 4": "A 14-year-old middle-schooler without health insurance relies on the free clinic for asthma care. He uses albuterol inhaler as needed and fluticasone 110 micrograms twice daily, but nighttime cough persists. Today we increased the fluticasone to 220 micrograms while arranging a voucher so his family can pick up the stronger inhaler at no cost.",
  "Patient 5": "A 62-year-old man on thrice-weekly dialysis for end-stage kidney disease was started today on glecaprevir-pibrentasvir to treat chronic hepatitis C. His list already includes carvedilol, sevelamer, and nightly pruritus lotion. Because the antiviral can raise tacrolimus levels and prolong QT, close lab checks and an updated cardiology note were ordered. He denies drug allergies.",
  "Patient 6": "Between shifts at a downtown caf\u00e9, 26-year-old Camila, currently uninsured, visited for worsening menstrual cramps and irregular bleeding. She takes only over-the-counter ibuprofen and has no allergies. Today she received her first prescription for a low-dose combined estrogen-progestin pill, taken once daily by mouth. Follow-up focuses on adherence and securing affordable refills.",
  "Patient 7": "Seventy-five-year-old Mr. Ruiz lives alone in a lakeside cabin and relies on mail-order medicines because winter roads often close. His only prescription is levothyroxine. After a recent lab showed slightly low thyroid-stimulating hormone, the tablet strength was decreased from 100 to 88 micrograms each morning. No medication allergies are documented.",
  "Patient 8": "Forty-two-year-old Devi, a Nepali-speaking seamstress, manages type 2 diabetes with metformin and long-acting insulin, but weight gain persists. Using an interpreter, she agreed to add weekly semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist, injected under the skin. She hopes to conceive, so counseling covered stopping the drug if pregnancy occurs and watching for nausea.",
  "Patient 9": "Sixty-three-year-old Malik, who still flies overseas for consulting work, carries a long list of medicines: dolutegravir and lamivudine for human immunodeficiency virus, amlodipine, low-dose aspirin, and omeprazole. Last week oncology began cabozantinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor for renal cancer. Because cabozantinib and dolutegravir both raise QT risk, he received instructions on keeping electrolytes normal and arranging monthly electrocardiograms. No drug allergies.",
  "Patient 10": "Fifteen-year-old Jalen, currently in foster care and switching schools frequently, was hospitalized last year for early-onset schizophrenia. Oral risperidone was hard to remember, so today he received his fourth monthly aripiprazole long-acting injection at the clinic. His only other medicine is vitamin D chewables. Caregivers were taught to watch for excessive sleepiness and sudden weight gain.",
  "Patient 11": "Ten-year-old Yusra, a recent refugee who speaks only Dari, comes with her aunt who interprets. She controls mild asthma with one puff of low-dose fluticasone twice daily and uses albuterol only during soccer. Because she has had no attacks in six months, we renewed the fluticasone without changes. She reports no drug allergies.",
  "Patient 12": "Twenty-three-year-old Ra\u00fal currently sleeps at a downtown shelter and often misplaces his pill bottles. He had been taking risperidone tablets, but missed doses triggered fresh auditory hallucinations. Today we switched him to a monthly under-the-skin paliperidone depot and arranged pharmacy delivery to the shelter. He also chews nicotine gum and has no known allergies.",
  "Patient 13": "Forty-two-year-old software designer Maya has never needed daily medicine but worries about rising weight and borderline blood sugar. After discussing diet and exercise, she agreed to start weekly semaglutide injections at the lowest dose. We reviewed possible nausea and the need to keep pens refrigerated. She is allergic to shellfish.",
  "Patient 14": "Sixty-eight-year-old Samuel juggles caregiving for his wife with managing his own long list of pills. He currently swallows lisinopril, atorvastatin, low-dose aspirin, gabapentin, and self-selected turmeric-ginger capsules from the health-food store. Complaining of morning grogginess, he agreed to taper off gabapentin and schedule a full medication review for deprescribing. No new symptoms or allergies emerged.",
  "Patient 15": "Eighty-two-year-old Mrs. Akiko lives in a skilled-nursing facility and recently began osimertinib, an oral treatment for lung cancer that can lengthen the heart\u2019s QT interval. She already takes metoprolol, furosemide, acetaminophen, and a daily multivitamin. Because azithromycin was started for bronchitis, we ordered baseline and follow-up electrocardiograms. She is allergic to sulfa drugs.",
  "Patient 16": "A 28-year-old call-center agent working night shifts asked for her first prescription for a combined estrogen\u2013progestin birth-control pill. She reports no chronic illnesses and only takes over-the-counter vitamin D gummies. Because she smokes fewer than five cigarettes a day, the clinician selected a low-dose formulation and scheduled a three-month follow-up.",
  "Patient 17": "Sixteen-year-old Bryce lives on a remote reservation and rides the community bus two hours for asthma visits. He has used budesonide inhaled steroid twice-daily since age nine. Today the dose was nudged up from 200 to 400 micrograms because spring smoke worsened his wheeze. No drug allergies are reported.",
  "Patient 18": "Fifty-four-year-old Marie, who speaks primarily Haitian Creole, manages type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and chronic knee pain. She currently takes metformin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and naproxen, and has a penicillin rash allergy. Because her weight has climbed, the team added weekly semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist, and explained injection technique using interpreter cards. Blood-sugar logs will be reviewed in six weeks.",
  "Patient 19": "Thirty-eight-year-old Marcus, an Army veteran presently sleeping in his car, carries a diagnosis of schizophrenia and opioid use disorder. He receives monthly aripiprazole injection at the drop-in clinic and takes buprenorphine\u2013naloxone films by mouth each morning. After losing his pill organizer, staff switched the films to a once-daily blister pack and documented his severe sulfa allergy. Case workers are arranging medication lockboxes.",
  "Patient 20": "Seventy-seven-year-old Captain Ellis lives on a small lighthouse island reachable only twice weekly by ferry. He just started imatinib tablets for newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia; other medicines include low-dose aspirin and atorvastatin. Because imatinib can suppress blood counts, the hematology team enrolled him in a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program and coordinated ferry vouchers for monthly labs. He reports no known drug allergies.",
  "Patient 21": "At 81, retired librarian Mrs. Hollis lives alone and relies on a visiting nurse to keep her pill organizer straight. She uses weekly methotrexate, daily folic acid, low-dose aspirin, amlodipine, and every-other-week adalimumab for rheumatoid arthritis. Because of new bruising, her doctor plans a slow prednisone taper, coordinating timing with the nurse.",
  "Patient 22": "Twenty-two-year-old track runner Kayla, covered by campus insurance, requested her first birth-control pill before summer training. She takes no other medication and has no known allergies. The clinician started a combined ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel tablet once daily and set a three-month follow-up to check side effects and blood-pressure readings.",
  "Patient 23": "A 45-year-old warehouse supervisor who speaks only Vietnamese attended with her daughter interpreting. Despite metformin and glipizide, her blood sugar logs stay high, so semaglutide injections once weekly were added today. She will pick up the starter pen at the pharmacy, watch bilingual teaching videos, and call if nausea or injection-site redness occurs.",
  "Patient 24": "Eleven-year-old Malik is staying at a downtown family shelter and keeps his inhaler in a shared locker. His only medicine is fluticasone inhaled twice daily for asthma, but he often forgets the evening dose. Today the dose was doubled to one stronger puff morning and night, and a spacer was provided to shorten administration time.",
  "Patient 25": "Sixty-four-year-old Mr. Alvarez, a retired electrician living in a coastal village two hours from cardiology services, began nilotinib tablets for chronic myeloid leukemia last month. He also takes lisinopril and simvastatin. Because nilotinib can prolong the QT interval, the team arranged monthly electrocardiograms at the nearby urgent-care clinic and paused his occasional over-the-counter cough syrup that contained dextromethorphan.",
  "Patient 26": "Ten-year-old Niko lives in a coastal Alaskan village reachable only by floatplane. His sole medicine, a budesonide-formoterol inhaler, was renewed today; dose remains two puffs morning and night for mild asthma. No allergies or other illnesses. The school nurse will log usage while winter ice keeps him far from pharmacies.",
  "Patient 27": "Twenty-two-year-old Avery, a deaf college student who uses American Sign Language, received her first long-acting risperidone injection today for bipolar disorder after missing several tablet doses. She also takes over-the-counter melatonin at bedtime. No known allergies. An interpreter reviewed lab follow-up and the need to return every four weeks.",
  "Patient 28": "Forty-five-year-old Jamal, recently paroled and staying at a halfway house, has hypertension and obesity. We stopped his sliding-scale insulin and started once-weekly semaglutide plus a lower lisinopril dose to cut injection frequency and pill burden. He still smokes but reports no drug allergies. Monthly pill counts and weight checks are planned.",
  "Patient 29": "Sixty-eight-year-old Helena migrates seasonally between Michigan and Arizona, complicating medication shipping. Her lung cancer therapy, the oral tyrosine-kinase inhibitor osimertinib, was lowered to 40 mg daily after a borderline QT interval. She also takes aspirin and atorvastatin. The pharmacy arranged mail-order refills and travel electrocardiograms at each snowbird location.",
  "Patient 30": "Eighty-two-year-old Mr. Castillo, living in a bilingual nursing home, started a five-day course of valacyclovir tablets for shingles and continues his daily vitamin D chew. Staff will stop the antiviral Sunday. He is allergic to penicillin but nothing else. Blister packs and large-print labels keep his regimen simple.",
  "Patient 31": "Seventeen-year-old Alex is living with his grandparents while both parents serve overseas. He only takes a once-daily 10-milligram loratadine tablet to keep spring allergies from flaring during soccer season. Today he asked for a one-year refill so he can keep pills in his locker. He reports no other medicines or allergies.",
  "Patient 32": "Thirty-four-year-old Amal, pregnant at 24 weeks and speaking through a phone interpreter, self-injects adalimumab every two weeks for Crohn\u2019s disease. The team reviewed that the biologic is considered safe and renewed the supply. Her prenatal vitamin continues, and lisinopril for mild hypertension was stopped once pregnancy was confirmed. No drug allergies were reported.",
  "Patient 33": "Eighty-year-old Mr. Coltrane, a retired jazz saxophonist with mild hearing loss, juggles seven daily medicines. Glyburide was discontinued last month, and a weekly semaglutide pen was started to improve diabetes control without low-sugar spells. He also takes low-dose aspirin, atorvastatin, lisinopril, and eye drops for glaucoma. He avoids sulfa antibiotics after a rash years ago.",
  "Patient 34": "Fifty-eight-year-old Clara leaves for a three-month medical mission in the Amazon next week. Her usual list\u2014atorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, and an albuterol inhaler\u2014remains unchanged, but she received atovaquone / proguanil for malaria plus a standby pack of nirmatrelvir with ritonavir for remote COVID treatment. Grapefruit warnings were reviewed because of her statin.",
  "Patient 35": "Twenty-seven-year-old Rina, currently couch-surfing and without insurance, requested reliable birth control she will not misplace. She received her first etonogestrel arm implant after confirming no hormone-related migraines. Aside from occasional ibuprofen for cramps, she takes nothing else and reports a penicillin allergy that caused hives as a child.",
  "Patient 36": "At 29, Katia drives for rideshare apps and keeps odd hours. Today she picked up her first prescription: a once-daily combined estrogen-progestin birth-control pill to regulate heavy periods. She takes no other medicines and reports a penicillin rash as her only allergy. A simple follow-up in three months is planned.",
  "Patient 37": "Twelve-year-old Noah lives year-round on his parents\u2019 canal boat, limiting easy clinic visits. His asthma remains mild; we increased his inhaled fluticasone from one to two puffs nightly for better fall pollen control. He otherwise takes only a chewable multivitamin and has no known allergies.",
  "Patient 38": "Eighty-three-year-old Mrs. Silva recently entered assisted living and relies on her grandson to translate Portuguese. Nighttime dementia agitation prompted her first monthly injection of depot risperidone. She also takes low-dose aspirin, vitamin D, and a water pill. Staff will watch for dizziness or heart-rhythm changes tied to risperidone\u2019s QT risk.",
  "Patient 39": "Forty-six-year-old Darren, recently laid off and without insurance, returned after a month\u2019s lapse in his human immunodeficiency virus pills. We restarted bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir once daily and arranged drug-assistance enrollment. He still takes amlodipine for blood pressure and a nightly heartburn tablet. A phone reminder system was set up to reduce missed doses.",
  "Patient 40": "Sixty-seven-year-old retired teacher Ms. Green departs on a six-week cruise through Southeast Asia next month. We continued her weekly under-the-skin semaglutide for diabetes but stopped glyburide to avoid low sugars during excursions. To cover travel, she begins atovaquone/proguanil the day before boarding. Current list also includes atorvastatin and a baby aspirin."
