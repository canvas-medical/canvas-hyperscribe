Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,"Reward for accurately documenting laboratory results: A1C decreased from 8.6% to 7.7% and creatinine remained 1.0 mg/dL, exactly as stated in the transcript.",10,60.0,6.0,"A1C 8.6→7.7 stated, but creatinine 1.0 mg/dL not mentioned."
2,"Reward for capturing the medication plan to escalate semaglutide from 0.25 mg to 0.5 mg next Sunday, including the specific injection instructions (thigh site, hold button 10 seconds, refrigerate pen cap for reuse).",15,90.0,13.5,"Escalation to 0.5 mg weekly, Sunday thigh, 10-sec hold, refrigerate cap all captured; start timing (“next Sunday”) not explicit."
3,"Reward for documenting the hypoglycemia episode (meter reading 62 mg/dL), the use of two glucose tablets, clinician attribution to delayed breakfast after glyburide discontinuation, and the instruction to keep glucose tabs in the sax case.",12,50.0,6.0,"Hypoglycemia 62 mg/dL and delayed-breakfast cause noted, but two glucose tablets and sax-case instruction omitted; glyburide stop only implied."
4,"Reward for noting insurance issues: prior-authorization rejection, provision of three sample pens covering twelve weeks, and clinician task to fax an appeal.",10,40.0,4.0,"Fax appeal task included, but prior-auth rejection and 3 sample pens/12 weeks not documented."
5,Reward for recording continuation of aspirin 81 mg daily with no generic substitution and guidance about bruising (call if purple patches exceed a guitar pick or if nosebleeds persist).,8,70.0,5.6,"Bruising/nosebleed guidance recorded, but continuation of aspirin 81 mg daily with no generic substitution not stated."
6,Reward for stating that the sulfonamide allergy will be flagged on every electronic prescription.,5,0.0,0.0,No mention of sulfonamide allergy flagging.
7,Reward for including the patient's report of tinnitus spike and clinician acknowledgment/uncertainty about its cause.,5,95.0,4.75,Tinnitus spike recorded with clinician uncertainty.
8,Reward for documenting that glaucoma eye-drops ran out early due to spillage and that a new prescription date is needed.,6,80.0,4.8,Eye-drop spillage and refill noted; new prescription date detail missing.
9,Reward for capturing glucometer usability instructions related to hearing loss (activate vibration alert and brighten display).,4,100.0,4.0,Vibration alert and bright display instructions fully documented.
10,Reward for noting follow-up plans: repeat labs and ophthalmology check scheduled in six weeks.,5,100.0,5.0,Repeat labs and ophthalmology follow-up in six weeks both documented.
11,Reward for documenting reassurance regarding possible interaction between semaglutide and lisinopril on kidney function and citing stable creatinine to support this.,4,30.0,1.2,"Interaction concern noted, but reassurance and stable creatinine value absent."
12,"Reward for overall completeness: the note captures all major decisions, patient concerns, instructions, and follow-up items discussed in the transcript without significant omissions.",12,65.0,7.8,"Note covers most key topics but omits creatinine value, sample pens, allergy flag, etc."
13,"Penalize for omitting or inaccurately representing key dosage or timing details of the semaglutide escalation plan (e.g., wrong dose, wrong start date, missing injection instructions).",10,85.0,-1.5,Semaglutide details accurate; only minor omission of explicit start date.
14,"Penalize for introducing information not present or implied in the transcript or relevant chart context (e.g., additional conditions, medications, lab values, social history) or for indiscriminate copying of chart data unrelated to this encounter.",8,90.0,-0.8,No significant extraneous information introduced beyond transcript context.
