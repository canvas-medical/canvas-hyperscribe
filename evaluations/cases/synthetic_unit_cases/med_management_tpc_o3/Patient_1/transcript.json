The active ingredients\u2014atovaquone and proguanil\u2014are the same no matter which generic they stock, so the tablet you might get later will look different but work identically. You\u2019d still take one tablet with your largest meal each day, starting two days before departure and for seven days after you leave Ghana. No dose change at all."

    "text": "Absolutely, and that\u2019s a smart strategy. The manufacturer prints dates on the foil, but you can also draw arrows or write the weekday next to each pocket, just avoid scratching through the tablet itself. Some travelers peel the whole week into a small pill box; that\u2019s fine too as long as it stays in your carry-on with the original label for customs. Whichever cue you choose, link it to a fixed meal, not the clock."

    "speaker": "Clinician",
    "text": "If a meal is delayed more than three hours, wait until you have at least a snack with some fat\u2014nuts or yogurt works. Taking it without food cuts absorption in half. Shellfish allergy doesn\u2019t overlap with this drug, but antihistamine in your kit is still wise. Vivid dreams? Rare with atovaquone-proguanil; more common with mefloquine, so you should be fine."
