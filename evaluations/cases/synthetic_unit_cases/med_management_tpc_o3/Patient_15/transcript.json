    "text": "Well, I read the pamphlet, and it said the pill could, uh, mess with my heartbeat, so when the nurse mentioned that 470 number I got scared. Yesterday during bingo I felt this flutter in my chest, like a bird, and my ears rang. I told them, but they just wrote it down and walked off. I\u2019m already on that metoprolol which slows things, and the furosemide makes me pee all day; I don\u2019t want any more pills piled on. And I know azithromycin can stretch the QT too\u2014why didn\u2019t anyone warn me before they started it? If my heart stops because two drugs are fighting, it\u2019s on the chart, and I\u2019m the one who pays, not the committee."
