  "Patient 15": "Eighty-two-year-old Mrs. Akiko lives in a skilled-nursing facility and recently began osimertinib, an oral treatment for lung cancer that can lengthen the heart\u2019s QT interval. She already takes metoprolol, furosemide, acetaminophen, and a daily multivitamin. Because azithromycin was started for bronchitis, we ordered baseline and follow-up electrocardiograms. She is allergic to sulfa drugs."
