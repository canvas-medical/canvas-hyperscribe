  {"speaker":"Clinician","text":"No worries, missing tablets happens. Today’s injection was 25 mg risperidone-er, slow release in the deltoid. It covers you for four weeks, so no tablets unless I message otherwise. Melatonin two gummies equals 10 mg; that’s still safe, just keep it at one gummy—5 mg—because higher doses can blur your daytime focus. Brand change: white generic is fine; same 2-mg strength. It dissolves the same. If the bottle predates today, recycle it so you don’t double medicate. Labs: Tuesday the 14th, anytime before 3 p.m.—we’ll check prolactin, kidney, and liver panels. Set two phone alarms and ask Disability Services for a visual reminder board. Sound okay?"}
