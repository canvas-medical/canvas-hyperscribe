  "Patient 28": "Forty-five-year-old Jamal, recently paroled and staying at a halfway house, has hypertension and obesity. We stopped his sliding-scale insulin and started once-weekly semaglutide plus a lower lisinopril dose to cut injection frequency and pill burden. He still smokes but reports no drug allergies. Monthly pill counts and weight checks are planned."
