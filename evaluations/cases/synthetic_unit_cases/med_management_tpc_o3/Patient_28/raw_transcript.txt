The refill block shows because the auto-approve covered only the first four pens; I’ve already faxed a new prior-auth and marked it urgent. You still have one unused pen in the fridge, correct?

And, uh, my shoulder still aches after the last shot."},{"speaker":"Clinician","text":"For the lisinopril, remember we halved the strength to ten milligrams once every morning; the blister pack with blue numbers is yours—write your initials on it so roommates can’t grab it by mistake. The shoulder soreness is common; ice for ten minutes and rotate sites, maybe abdomen next time."}]
