What that means is just one puff in the morning and one puff at night, same schedule, but you\u2019ll get double the medicine with each spray. It should calm the wheeze faster, and you don\u2019t have to take two puffs anymore."

    "text": "Also, I slipped a clear spacer into your bag; think of it like a hallway that gives the mist time to break up, so you can inhale in a single slow breath. Pop the inhaler into the blue end, shake once, puff, then breathe in for four seconds, hold for five, and you\u2019re done\u2014way quicker than fiddling with two sprays."

    "text": "Now, you told me the locker line sometimes closes before lights-out, and that\u2019s when the evening dose slips, right? Let\u2019s brainstorm: could we keep the spacer and inhaler with the night supervisor, or maybe set a phone alarm that reminds you to grab them right after dinner before the lockers shut?"

    "text": "Um\u2026 yeah, I, I try, but the line gets super long and everyone watches if you ask to cut, and I feel stupid because it\u2019s just for my \u2018stupid\u2019 inhaler. Last night I waited and then the guard said, \u2018lights out,\u2019 so I just went to bed. I woke up coughing and my chest felt tight. I don\u2019t wanna mess up and make Mom worry. If I carry it around the littler kids might take it, and my phone is dead half the time, so alarms don\u2019t always buzz."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Clinician",
    "text": "Okay, first, it\u2019s not stupid at all, you\u2019re taking care of your lungs. How about we stash the inhaler in the nurses\u2019 cabinet instead of the locker? They stay open until 10 p.m., which beats the guard\u2019s cutoff. I can write a quick note so the staff knows it\u2019s yours and lets you step in, no questions, even if the hallway\u2019s crowded."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "That might work. I can, uh, ask Ms. Tanya, she\u2019s nice. Will the medicine taste different now that it\u2019s stronger? Sometimes after I puff I get this weird scratchy voice and the kids tease me, like \u2018frog throat.\u2019 And Mom said steroids can make you, um, chunky\u2014am I gonna blow up like a balloon if it\u2019s double?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Clinician",
    "text": "The medicine hasn\u2019t changed taste; it\u2019s the same powder in a bigger puff. Frog voice happens when leftover spray sticks to your throat, so after every dose swish water, gargle ten seconds, and spit\u2014no gulping. The dose is still tiny compared with pills, so it won\u2019t bulk you up. If your voice stays raspy or you see white spots, let me know and we\u2019ll check for thrush."
