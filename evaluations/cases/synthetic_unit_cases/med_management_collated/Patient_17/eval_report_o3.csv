1,"Reward for capturing all patient-reported concerns and relevant symptom details (increased hunger since starting glipizide, anxiety about weight gain, resolved cough after stopping lisinopril, new ankle swelling since starting losartan) with timing/context in the History of Present Illness.",20,60,12.0,"Captured increased hunger since starting glipizide and ankle swelling since switching to losartan; mentioned cough related to lisinopril stop but did not state that cough resolved, omitted timing/context details."
2,"Reward for listing each current medication with correct name and dose (metformin 500 mg, glipizide 5 mg, losartan 50 mg), documenting adherence/effectiveness, and explicitly linking glipizide to increased appetite and losartan to ankle edema.",20,30,6.0,"Did not list metformin at all, no doses given for any drug, no adherence/effectiveness comments, only partial linkage of glipizide to hunger and losartan to edema."
3,"Reward for documenting a concrete, patient-specific safety monitoring plan including: daily home glucose logs, regular weight tracking, hypoglycemia education, ankle-swelling monitoring strategy, renal function & potassium labs ordered, and a follow-up timeframe.",25,5,1.25,"No home glucose log, weight tracking, hypoglycemia education, edema monitoring, labs, or follow-up plan documented."
4,"Reward for noting evidence-based management options (dietary counseling per ADA guidance, consideration of switching from sulfonylurea to weight-neutral agent if appetite/weight gain persists, and dose adjustment or alternative antihypertensive if edema continues).",15,5,0.75,"No discussion of diet counseling, alternative agents, or antihypertensive change."
5,"Penalize for omission of objective data critical for safe decision-making, specifically missing vital signs (blood pressure, weight), physical exam findings of ankle edema, or recent glucose/A1c values.",15,10,1.5,"All vital signs, exam findings, and glucose/A1c data absent; major safety data missing."
6,Penalize for redundant chart copy or irrelevant verbose text that does not add encounter-specific information.,5,90,4.5,Note is brief and encounter-focused with no obvious boilerplate or irrelevant text.
