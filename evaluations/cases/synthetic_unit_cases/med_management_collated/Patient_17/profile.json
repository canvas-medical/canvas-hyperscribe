  "Patient 17": "This 58-year-old woman, a retired nurse, has been managing her type 2 diabetes with metformin 500 mg twice daily for the past decade. Recently, her HbA1c levels have been creeping up, leading to the addition of glipizide 5 mg daily. She has a history of hypertension, controlled with losartan 50 mg daily, switched from lisinopril due to a persistent cough. She is allergic to penicillin, which is well-documented in her records."
