Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,"Reward for documenting a concise, accurate HPI that captures the patient-reported decrease in palpitations since levothyroxine dose adjustment, persistence of occasional episodes, and associated worry",15,60,9.0,"Narrative states palpitations less frequent since dose change and still occur occasionally, but lacks detail on frequency, duration, and patient worry."
2,Reward for recording medication adherence challenges (difficulty obtaining refills) and a concrete plan or task to facilitate delivery/refill of levothyroxine,15,50,7.5,"Plan for medication delivery is documented, but note does not explicitly mention refill difficulty or adherence history."
3,Reward for explicitly noting the transportation barrier as a social determinant of health and linking it to the chosen intervention (pharmacy delivery service),10,85,8.5,Transportation barrier explicitly cited and directly tied to pharmacy delivery intervention.
4,"Reward for providing an updated assessment of hypothyroidism, including current levothyroxine dose and acknowledgement of prior dose adjustment",15,65,9.75,Assessment notes improvement after dose adjustment but omits the actual levothyroxine dose amount.
5,Reward for including an evidence-based follow-up plan such as ordering or scheduling a TSH level (or equivalent) within 6â€“8 weeks to evaluate adequacy of the new dose and palpitations,15,5,0.75,No order or plan for follow-up TSH or timing provided.
6,"Reward for documenting a patient safety plan that addresses potential escalation (e.g., instructions to seek urgent care if palpitations worsen, are accompanied by dizziness, chest pain, or syncope)",15,0,0.0,No safety or escalation instructions documented for worsening palpitations.
7,"Penalize for reiterating information already present in the chart (e.g., past medical history, unchanged medication lists) without adding new, visit-specific detail",7,90,6.3,Note contains minimal repetition of charted history; largely visit-focused content.
8,"Penalize for omission or inaccuracy of key encounter details such as current levothyroxine dose, specifics of palpitations, or the agreed plan for medication delivery/refill",8,30,2.4,"Key details missing (exact dose, follow-up testing, explicit refill plan), leading to partial omissions."
