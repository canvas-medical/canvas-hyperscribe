Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,Reward for explicitly documenting the patient's reported non-adherence to losartan (frequency of missed doses) and the stated reason (irregular schedule while driving for work).,20,30,6.0,"Note mentions taking losartan ""when not driving"" implying reason for missed doses but omits any detail on frequency of missed doses."
2,"Reward for capturing the counseling provided on adherence tools (phone reminders, pill organizer) and recording the patient's response to each suggestion.",15,5,0.75,"No discussion of phone reminders, pill organizers, or patient reaction noted."
3,"Reward for documenting the agreed plan to shift losartan dosing to bedtime, including specific instructions (once daily at night) and confirmation that patient will try this approach.",15,40,6.0,Provides a bedtime dosing suggestion but lacks explicit once-daily instruction or documentation that patient agreed.
4,"Reward for including safety advice related to bedtime dosing of an antihypertensive (e.g., caution about dizziness/orthostatic symptoms, guidance on what to do if adverse effects occur, not skipping doses).",15,0,0.0,"No counseling on dizziness, orthostasis, or actions if adverse effects occur."
5,"Reward for noting an evidence-based rationale that losartan is effective with once-daily dosing and generally does not disturb sleep, supporting the change.",10,0,0.0,Does not state any evidence-based explanation of losartan’s pharmacology or sleep neutrality.
6,"Reward for specifying a follow-up plan to monitor blood pressure control and medication tolerance (e.g., schedule visit or remote BP log).",10,0,0.0,No plan for BP monitoring or follow-up visit/log documented.
7,"Penalize for including redundant chart data or prior history that was not discussed or updated in this segment (e.g., re-listing unchanged medication list, demographics) beyond what is needed to contextualize the new information.",8,100,8.0,No extraneous medication lists or demographic repetition; thus no redundancy to penalize.
8,Reward for documenting the patient’s occupational travel pattern as a social determinant impacting medication adherence.,7,40,2.8,Reference to driving for work hints at travel schedule affecting adherence but lacks fuller description.
