Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,"Reward for accurate and succinct HPI documentation of the patient’s statin-associated muscle aches, capturing location (legs), timing (worse after sitting, evenings), aggravating factors, and the patient’s level of concern",25,85.0,21.25,"HPI states leg location, worse after sitting and in evenings, notes patient concern; overall concise."
2,"Reward for explicitly linking the muscle aches to atorvastatin and recording pertinent risk factors (current atorvastatin use, age >65, hypothyroidism) to support consideration of statin-induced myopathy",20,40.0,8.0,"Mentions current atorvastatin but omits explicit causal language and other risk factors (age, hypothyroidism)."
3,"Reward for documenting an evidence-based assessment and plan addressing possible statin-associated myopathy, including consideration or ordering of CK/LFT labs, dose-timing change or alternative statin, and a concrete follow-up timeline",25,5.0,1.25,"No assessment/plan, labs, dosing changes, or follow-up documented."
4,"Penalize for absence of patient safety counseling on red-flag symptoms of severe muscle injury (e.g., weakness, dark urine) and clear instructions about when to stop the medication or seek urgent care",15,0.0,0.0,No safety counseling or stop-criteria provided.
5,Penalize for inclusion of irrelevant or redundant chart data or excessive narrative not directly pertinent to today’s statin-related muscle ache discussion,10,95.0,9.5,Note is brief with no irrelevant or redundant content.
6,"Reward for correct and efficient use of Canvas structured instructions (HistoryOfPresentIllness, Assess Hyperlipidemia, possible LabOrder for CK, FollowUp) in compliance with one-per-type constraints",5,60.0,3.0,"Uses correct single HPI command, but omits other structured elements (assessment, labs, follow-up)."
