Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,"Reward for documenting in the HPI all patient-reported details from this segment: relief of stomach pain on celecoxib vs. ibuprofen, stable home BP around 120/80 with no changes, and current activity level (light walking and stretching) limited by arthritis",22,95.0,20.9,"All three required patient-reported elements—relief of stomach pain on celecoxib vs ibuprofen, stable home BP 120/80, and light walking/stretching limited by arthritis—are explicitly present in the HPI narrative."
2,"Reward for accurately recording medication review and counseling: current celecoxib and amlodipine use, rationale that celecoxib is gentler on stomach, advice to monitor BP and watch for edema or other side-effects",22,60.0,13.2,"Current celecoxib and amlodipine are listed. Narrative notes celecoxib is easier on stomach (rationale). However, counseling to monitor BP and watch for edema/side-effects is absent."
3,"Reward for including a clear patient safety plan related to celecoxib and hypertension (continue home BP checks, monitor for swelling/unusual symptoms, instructions on when to call)",20,10.0,2.0,"Only general instruction to “keep up with current routine” is given; no explicit plan to continue BP checks, monitor for swelling, or guidance on when to call."
4,"Reward for documenting specific evidence-based lifestyle guidance provided (salt restriction for BP control, encouragement of appropriate physical activity/stretching despite arthritis)",12,70.0,8.4,"Lifestyle advice includes salt restriction and encouragement to continue light activity, but lacks detail on specific exercise parameters or salt goals."
5,Reward for recording the known aspirin allergy and demonstrating allergy reconciliation by avoiding aspirin-containing recommendations,8,0.0,0.0,No mention of the documented aspirin allergy or reconciliation in the note.
6,Penalize for missing or inaccurate assessment and/or plan entries for the two chronic conditions actively discussed (osteoarthritis pain control and hypertension management),12,80.0,9.6,There is no clear assessment/plan for osteoarthritis pain control or hypertension; thus major essential content is missing.
7,"Penalize for redundant or non-pertinent content (e.g., unnecessary chart copy-pasting, verbatim transcript segments, or information not directly relevant to this encounter segment)",4,10.0,0.4,"Note is concise with minimal non-pertinent content; only slight generic phrasing, no obvious redundancy."
