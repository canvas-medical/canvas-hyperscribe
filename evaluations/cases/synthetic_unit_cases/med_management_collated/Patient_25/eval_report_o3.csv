Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,"Reward for explicitly documenting the patient-reported adherence gap (running out of tiotropium for 1-2 days due to delayed refill requests) in HistoryOfPresentIllness or Assessment, including the stated barrier of feeling overwhelmed/forgetfulness",25,0,0,No note produced; adherence gap not mentioned at all.
2,"Reward for recording a concrete intervention to improve adherenceâ€”e.g., creating an Instruct or Task to set up automatic pharmacy refills for the tiotropium inhaler (and optionally other COPD meds)",20,0,0,No intervention or task about automatic refills documented.
3,"Reward for linking missed inhaler doses to potential COPD exacerbation or other patient-safety risk, and documenting this risk and the mitigation plan",15,0,0,No linkage between missed doses and COPD exacerbation risk recorded.
4,Reward for demonstrating evidence-based COPD management by maintaining current maintenance therapy (no unnecessary medication changes) and focusing plan on adherence support in line with guidelines,10,10,1,"No plan documented; while no inappropriate changes were made, the required evidence-based adherence focus is absent."
5,"Reward for using appropriate, non-redundant Canvas instruction types (e.g., Refill for tiotropium, Instruct on automatic refill, Task for staff/pharmacy) with correct medication name, dose, and frequency",10,0,0,"No Canvas instructions, refill orders, or medication details provided."
6,"Penalize for introducing new diagnoses, medication changes, or orders not supported by the transcript (e.g., altering prednisone, adding new drugs, ordering tests)",15,100,15,"Because nothing was added, no unsupported diagnoses/medication changes were made."
7,"Penalize for omitting key medication detail (name, strength, frequency) or missing any mention of tiotropium when documenting refill/adherence plan",10,0,0,"Tiotropium and its details were entirely omitted, triggering the penalty."
8,"Penalize for excessive redundancy or inclusion of irrelevant chart data not touched on in the conversation (e.g., copying entire past medical history without need)",5,100,5,"With no content, there is no redundancy or irrelevant data."
