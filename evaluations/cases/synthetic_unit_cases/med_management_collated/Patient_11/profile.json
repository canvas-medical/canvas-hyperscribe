  "Patient 11": "A 52-year-old woman, who works as a librarian, has been managing her hypertension with amlodipine 10 mg daily for the past five years. She was initially on lisinopril, but developed a persistent cough, prompting the switch. Her family history is significant for cardiovascular disease, which has made her vigilant about medication adherence. She has no known drug allergies and lives alone, which sometimes affects her ability to refill prescriptions promptly."
