Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,"Reward for documenting a focused HPI that explicitly includes: timing of nausea (morning), temporal relation to lithium ingestion, partial relief with food, duration of symptoms (improves by lunchtime), patient's worry about long-term effects and hospitalization, and presence of partner support/reminders.",25,70.0,17.5,"Includes morning nausea, relation to lithium ingestion, improvement by lunchtime, relief with food; missing patient worries and partner support."
2,Reward for accurately recording the current lithium regimen (300 mg twice daily) and linking it to the reported nausea and adherence details.,20,25.0,5.0,Mentions lithium but omits exact 300 mg BID regimen and adherence details; only loosely links nausea to lithium.
3,Reward for including a clear safety plan that orders or schedules appropriate lithium level and renal/thyroid function monitoring with a defined timeframe.,25,0.0,0.0,No documentation of lithium level or renal/thyroid monitoring plan or timeframe.
4,"Reward for documenting evidence-based counseling/management to mitigate nausea (e.g., take lithium with food, consider dose or timing adjustment if symptoms persist) while balancing benefits and risks.",20,55.0,11.0,Provides counseling to take lithium with food but lacks further evidence-based options (dose/timing adjustment discussion).
5,"Penalize for any recommendation or statement that changes or stops lithium therapy without arranging concurrent level monitoring or follow-up, or that incorrectly states monitoring is unnecessary.",10,100.0,10.0,No advice to stop or change lithium without monitoring; no incorrect statements about monitoring.
