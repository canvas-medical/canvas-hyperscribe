Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,"Reward for accurately documenting the patient's expressed concern/question about whether losartan alone is sufficient for blood pressure control (i.e., capturing the chief complaint/reason for visit in the HPI).",15,10,1.5,Note lacks any mention of the patient asking if losartan alone is enough; only states hypertension is stable.
2,Reward for recording the patient's home blood-pressure monitoring details (frequency and recent readings) and noting the clinician's assessment that the readings have been stable.,15,25,3.75,"Mentions stability ""based on recent readings"" but supplies no numeric values or monitoring schedule."
3,"Reward for documenting medication reconciliation and adherence assessment, including the specific inquiry about atorvastatin-related muscle aches and the patient's negative response.",15,0,0,"No medication list, reconciliation, or inquiry about atorvastatin muscle aches documented."
4,"Reward for capturing discussion of lifestyle factors (diet, exercise, work stress) and any counseling or reinforcement provided by the clinician.",10,0,0,"No discussion of diet, exercise, or stress; no counseling recorded."
5,"Reward for stating a clear plan for continued home BP monitoring, instructions to report new side effects, and timing/arrangements for follow-up.",10,30,3,Provides generic instruction to keep monitoring BP but omits guidance on reporting side-effects or follow-up timing.
6,"Penalize for missing documentation of objective safety data or plan (e.g., failure to record in-office vitals or order/plan labs such as lipid panel or creatine kinase when monitoring statin therapy), thereby posing potential patient-safety risk.",20,90,-18,No in-office vitals or lab orders recorded; represents significant safety omission.
7,"Penalize for redundant inclusion of information already present in the chart (e.g., restating full medication lists or chronic conditions) without adding new, encounter-specific relevance.",5,15,-0.75,Minimal redundancy; slight repetition of same sentence in narrative/background but otherwise concise.
8,"Reward for explicitly linking management decisions to evidence-based guidelines (e.g., continuing current ARB and statin dosages because BP readings are controlled and no statin side effects reported, and planning routine guideline-recommended labs).",10,5,0.5,Note does not reference any guidelines or evidence for management choices.
