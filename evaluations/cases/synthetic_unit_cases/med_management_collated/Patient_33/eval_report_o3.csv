2,Reward for explicitly recording the clinician's counseling: taking metformin with meals to lessen GI upset and using phone reminders or tying the dose to a routine to improve adherence,25,50,12.5,"Counseling about taking metformin with meals captured, but no mention of phone reminders or tying dose to routine."
3,Reward for including concise patient-safety instructions about handling missed doses and monitoring/mitigating gastrointestinal side-effects in line with metformin best-practice guidelines,15,0,0,No instructions about handling missed doses or monitoring side-effects beyond general GI comment.
4,"Penalize for adding, discontinuing, or modifying any medication orders (e.g., changing metformin dose, frequency, or adding new drugs) that were not discussed or indicated in this transcript segment",15,100,15,No unauthorized medication changes were introduced; therefore no penalty.
