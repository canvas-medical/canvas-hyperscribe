Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,"Reward for detailed documentation of the patient’s self-reported progress and ongoing challenges with carbohydrate counting and matching insulin lispro doses, including specific scenarios (eating out versus at home) mentioned in the encounter",25,0,0,"No note at all, so no patient-reported progress, challenges, or scenarios documented."
2,"Reward for documenting the specific self-management education or instructions provided by the clinician during the visit (e.g., recommendation to use carb-counting apps, acknowledgment that adaptation takes time)",20,0,0,No description of any self-management education or instructions provided.
3,"Reward for accurately listing the patient’s current insulin regimen (glargine basal, lispro bolus) and any discussed dose adjustments, adherence issues, or observed glycemic patterns",15,0,0,Current insulin regimen and dose information completely absent.
4,"Penalize for failure to document an assessment of recent hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia episodes and an associated safety plan (e.g., glucose monitoring guidance, recognition/management of lows) while advising insulin adjustment",20,0,0,No assessment of recent hypo/hyperglycemia or safety planning; full omission of required content.
5,"Reward for explicitly linking counseling to evidence-based guidelines for Type 1 diabetes self-management (e.g., ADA recommendations on carb counting and insulin-to-carb ratios) or otherwise stating a clear clinical rationale for advice given",10,0,0,No mention of guidelines or rationale for counseling because no counseling documented.
6,"Penalize for inclusion of redundant, irrelevant, or copy-pasted information not directly pertinent to this encounter segment, resulting in unnecessary wordiness",10,95,9.5,"The note is empty, so it contains no redundant or irrelevant text; thus the criterion is fully satisfied."
