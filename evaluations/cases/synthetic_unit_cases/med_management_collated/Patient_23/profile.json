  "Patient 23": "A 32-year-old man, recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, has been started on insulin glargine and insulin lispro. He is adjusting to the new regimen and learning to count carbohydrates to manage his blood sugar levels effectively. He has no significant family history of diabetes, which made the diagnosis unexpected. He is motivated to maintain a healthy lifestyle and attends regular follow-ups with his endocrinologist."
