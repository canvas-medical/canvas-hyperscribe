Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,"Reward for documenting in the HPI that the patient missed one dose of glipizide while traveling last week, noticed higher blood-sugar readings afterward, and normally relies on wife reminders and phone alarms",18,0,0,"No HistoryOfPresentIllness section; missed-dose details, higher glucose readings, wife reminders, phone alarms all absent."
2,"Reward for including an Assess instruction that evaluates current type 2 diabetes control, explicitly links the transient hyperglycemia to the missed sulfonylurea dose, and states that no medication change is required at this time",18,0,0,"No Assess command provided; no link between transient hyperglycemia and missed sulfonylurea dose, no statement about medication plan."
3,"Reward for recording an Instruct instruction that gives specific adherence strategies (e.g., pill organizer, phone alarms when traveling) to prevent future missed doses",15,55,8.25,"Instruct command suggests a pill organizer for trips, but omits phone alarms or other concrete adherence tools."
4,Penalize for failure to document patient-safety guidance about monitoring for hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia after missed doses and when to seek medical attention,12,100,-12,Note lacks any advice about monitoring for hyper- or hypoglycemia after missed doses or guidance on when to seek care.
5,"Reward for using only relevant Canvas commands (HistoryOfPresentIllness, Assess, Instruct) without introducing unnecessary or incorrect command types",10,90,9,Uses only a single Instruct command—no irrelevant or incorrect Canvas commands present.
6,"Penalize for redundantly copying unchanged chart details (e.g., full medication list, demographics) instead of focusing on new encounter content",9,0,0,Did not copy medication list or other unchanged chart data—no redundancy detected.
7,Penalize for adding or changing prescriptions or dosages in response to this single missed dose without documented clinical indication,10,0,0,"No prescriptions or dosages were added or modified, so no wrongful changes."
8,"Reward for noting social context and barriers (traveling to visit daughter, family involvement) that affect medication adherence",8,35,2.8,"Briefly references travel (“for trips”) implying situational barrier, but no family context or broader social details."
