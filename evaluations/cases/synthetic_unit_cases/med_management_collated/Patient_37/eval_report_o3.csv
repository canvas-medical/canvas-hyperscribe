Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,Reward for explicit documentation of the patient’s request to move metformin dosing from breakfast to lunch AND the clinician’s agreement or instructions about that change,20,0,0,"There is no documentation at all, so the patient’s request to change metformin timing and the clinician’s response are completely absent."
2,"Reward for documenting the discussion of medication adherence and self-monitoring of blood glucose (frequency, instances of forgetting, or consistency)",15,0,0,No mention of medication adherence or SMBG; criterion entirely unmet.
3,"Reward for inclusion of patient-safety counseling related to metformin timing (need for consistency, taking with food to minimize GI side-effects, what to do if a dose is missed)",20,0,0,"No counseling about timing consistency, taking with food, or missed-dose instructions is present."
4,Reward for demonstrating evidence-based decision making by noting that metformin may be taken with any main meal without dose change and no anticipated impact on glycemic control,10,0,0,No evidence-based note explaining flexibility of metformin dosing was documented.
5,"Penalize for missing, incorrect, or conflicting core medication details for metformin (name, dose, route, frequency) in the documentation",15,0,0,"All core medication details (name, dose, route, frequency) are missing, so this negative criterion is fully triggered."
6,"Penalize for absence of a documented follow-up or monitoring plan pertinent to diabetes control (e.g., SMBG schedule reinforcement or HbA1c/lab follow-up timeline)",10,0,0,There is no follow-up or monitoring plan for diabetes; criterion fully unmet.
7,"Penalize for improper or inconsistent use of Canvas instruction categories (e.g., using AdjustPrescription when only counseling is given, or omitting an Instruct entry when counseling is documented)",5,10,0.5,"Because no Canvas instruction categories were used at all, required Instruct/AdjustPrescription elements are missing; partial penalty assigned."
8,"Penalize for redundant, overly wordy, or irrelevant information not supported by the transcript or chart",5,100,5,"Empty note contains no redundancy or irrelevant information, so no penalty here."
