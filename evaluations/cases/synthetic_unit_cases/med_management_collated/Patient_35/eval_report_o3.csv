Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,"Reward for clearly and concisely documenting the patient-reported status of each active medication, including: no cough with losartan, occasional fatigue possibly related to losartan, stable energy on levothyroxine, and anxiety about missing doses.",25,5.0,1.25,"No patient-reported statuses (no cough, fatigue, stable energy, anxiety) documented; only generic medication statements given."
2,"Reward for capturing the clinician’s counseling verbatim or in essence: potential losartan side effects (dizziness, fatigue), instruction to monitor symptoms and report worsening, and specific guidance on what to do when a levothyroxine dose is missed.",20,20.0,4.0,Captures a generic missed-dose instruction but omits losartan side-effect counseling and monitoring advice.
3,"Reward for including an evidence-based safety/monitoring plan that reflects guideline standards for these medications—e.g., continue current doses, self-monitor blood pressure, obtain renal function/electrolytes for losartan and TSH for levothyroxine within an appropriate follow-up interval.",20,0.0,0.0,"No safety or monitoring plan, no BP self-monitoring, no lab orders; criterion completely unmet."
4,"Penalize for omission or inaccurate recording of any key subjective or counseling element from this encounter (patient fatigue, no cough, stable energy, side-effect discussion, missed-dose instructions).",15,20.0,3.0,"Major subjective and counseling elements omitted (fatigue, no cough, energy level, side-effects); only partial missed-dose advice recorded."
5,"Penalize for failure to use, or incorrect use of, appropriate Canvas structured instructions to record assessments for hypertension and hypothyroidism, medication instructions, or indicated lab orders arising from this segment.",10,40.0,4.0,"Used MedicationStatement and Instruct commands, but lacked structured assessments and lab orders; partial compliance."
6,"Penalize for inclusion of redundant or irrelevant information that is not new to this encounter segment (e.g., repeating full medication lists or unrelated historical data) resulting in excessive wordiness.",10,80.0,8.0,Note is concise; only mildly irrelevant family-history line included—minimal redundancy.
