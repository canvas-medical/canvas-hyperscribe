Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,"Reward for accurately documenting the patient's subjective report that she has no cough while on losartan, notes only occasional fatigue, and voices questions about side-effects of losartan and atorvastatin",25,0,0,"Subjective findings (no cough on losartan, only occasional fatigue, patient questions about side-effects) are not mentioned at all."
2,"Reward for explicitly recording the clinicianâ€™s counseling on common side-effects (dizziness/fatigue for losartan, muscle pain for atorvastatin) and the instruction to notify the provider if these occur",30,90,27,"Note explicitly instructs patient to report dizziness/fatigue on losartan and muscle aches on atorvastatin, matching requested counseling; minor detail omissions (e.g., term ""common side-effects"" not stated) slightly lower completeness."
3,Reward for stating a clear safety plan to continue current medications unchanged while monitoring for side-effects and willingness to adjust therapy if symptoms develop,15,0,0,No statement addressing continuation of current regimen or monitoring plan; safety plan absent.
4,"Penalize for including redundant or irrelevant chart information not brought up in the transcript (e.g., full medication lists, past conditions) or for excessive wordiness beyond encounter-specific details",10,98,9.8,Very concise; only encounter-specific counseling appears. No extraneous medication lists or irrelevant history; slight duplication of SNOMED template but negligible.
5,"Penalize for documenting information that contradicts the transcript or pharmacologic facts (e.g., claiming cough persists, attributing muscle pain to losartan) or other clinically incorrect statements",20,100,20,No content contradicts the transcript or pharmacology; instructions are clinically accurate.
