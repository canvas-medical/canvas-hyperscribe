Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,"Reward for HPI that clearly documents the patient’s lightheadedness/dizziness episodes with timing relative to morning amlodipine intake, adequacy of breakfast, and work on scaffolding, including frequency and severity",20,40.0,8.0,"Mentions dizziness occurs after morning amlodipine and that breakfast is often only coffee, but omits frequency, severity, and scaffold-related timing."
2,Reward for explicit assessment linking dizziness to possible amlodipine-induced hypotension and listing a brief differential diagnosis,15,25.0,3.75,Only implicit link between amlodipine and dizziness; no explicit assessment section or differential given.
3,"Reward for evidence-based plan: advise taking amlodipine with substantial food, outline home or in-clinic blood pressure monitoring, propose dose/timing adjustment if symptoms persist, and specify follow-up interval",20,20.0,4.0,"Plan advises larger breakfast but lacks BP monitoring, dose/timing adjustment, or follow-up instructions."
4,"Reward for documenting occupational safety guidance (e.g., avoiding scaffold work when dizzy, instructions on when to stop work or seek care)",10,0.0,0.0,No occupational safety instructions about avoiding scaffold work when dizzy.
5,Reward for concise documentation that omits redundant chart data not directly pertinent to today’s encounter,10,80.0,8.0,Note is brief and avoids unrelated chart data; documentation is largely concise.
6,Penalize for absence of documented vital signs or orthostatic blood pressure measurement plan despite complaint of lightheadedness,15,90.0,13.5,"No vitals recorded or orthostatic measurement plan despite lightheadedness complaint, fully triggering this penalty."
7,"Penalize for continuing amlodipine without any monitoring or dose-adjustment plan despite reported dizziness, indicating unsafe management",10,80.0,8.0,"Continues amlodipine without monitoring or dose change; only suggests bigger breakfast, so unsafe management penalty applies."
