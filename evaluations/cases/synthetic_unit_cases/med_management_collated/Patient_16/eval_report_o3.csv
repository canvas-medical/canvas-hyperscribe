Criterion #,Criterion,Max Score,Satisfaction (%),Score Awarded,Rationale
1,Reward for clearly documenting the patient's primary concern/reason for visit (worry about long-term atorvastatin effects and possible statin side effects) in a single ReasonForVisit instruction,10,5.0,0.5,"No ReasonForVisit instruction present, so primary concern not documented."
2,"Reward for a thorough, non-redundant HistoryOfPresentIllness that captures fatigue after cycling, absence of muscle pain, timing, context, and any exacerbating/relieving factors",20,0.0,0.0,"No HistoryOfPresentIllness instruction at all; fatigue details, timing, context entirely absent."
3,"Reward for accurate medication reconciliation and monitoring: listing current atorvastatin 10 mg, noting adherence, querying side effects, and recording any reported symptoms",15,25.0,3.75,"Atorvastatin listed without dose (10 mg), frequency, adherence, or side-effect inquiry—partial reconciliation only."
4,"Reward for evidence-based assessment and plan: continue atorvastatin given cardiovascular risk, include conditional LabOrder for LFT/CK if symptoms persist, and document rationale referencing family history of MI",25,0.0,0.0,"No Assess or Plan instructions; no rationale to continue statin, no lab orders for LFT/CK, no family-history reference."
5,"Reward for documenting lifestyle counseling (dietary saturated-fat reduction, increased fiber) and confirming patient understanding within an Instruct instruction",10,85.0,8.5,Dietary counseling instruction explicitly advises reducing saturated fat and increasing fiber and is in an Instruct instruction.
6,"Penalize for omission or inadequate documentation of patient-safety monitoring (failure to mention lab monitoring plan, advice to report worsening muscle symptoms, or criteria to stop medication)",15,10.0,1.5,"Safety monitoring absent—no advice about reporting muscle pain, stopping medication, or lab follow-up."
7,"Penalize for redundant copying of chart data or unnecessary verbosity that does not add new, encounter-specific information",5,90.0,4.5,Note is concise with no redundant chart copy.
8,"Reward for correct, concise use of Canvas instruction types (e.g., HistoryOfPresentIllness, LabOrder, Assess, Instruct) without misclassification or missing required instructions",10,40.0,4.0,"Correct command types used for medication and counseling, but missing required ReasonForVisit, HPI, Assess, LabOrder; partial compliance."
