  "Patient 16": "A 34-year-old man, who works as a software developer, was recently started on atorvastatin 10 mg daily after his annual check-up revealed elevated cholesterol levels. He has no significant past medical history and no known drug allergies. His family history is notable for his father having a heart attack at age 50, which prompted the early intervention. He is otherwise healthy and leads an active lifestyle, cycling to work daily."
