  "Patient 7": "This 62-year-old woman, a retired school teacher, has been on levothyroxine 75 mcg daily for hypothyroidism for over a decade. Recently, her TSH levels indicated the need for a dose adjustment to 88 mcg. She also takes atorvastatin 20 mg for hyperlipidemia, which was started after her brother suffered a heart attack. She reports no side effects from her medications and has no known allergies. Her adherence is excellent, supported by her routine lifestyle."
