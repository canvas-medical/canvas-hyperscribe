  {"character": "patient", "text": "Yeah, thanks. I’ve just been so drained lately, it’s hard to get through the day."},
  {"character": "doctor", "text": "That sounds tough. How long has this been happening?"},
  {"character": "patient", "text": "Probably the last couple of weeks, maybe longer. I didn’t really notice at first."},
  {"character": "doctor", "text": "Anything else along with the fatigue? Like fever, night sweats, weight loss?"},
  {"character": "patient", "text": "Not really. I mean, I might’ve dropped a pound or two but I haven’t been checking."},
  {"character": "doctor", "text": "And how’s your sleep been?"},
  {"character": "patient", "text": "It’s okay. I fall asleep fine but wake up a lot at night."},
  {"character": "doctor", "text": "Do you feel rested at all when you wake up?"},

  {"character": "doctor", "text": "Any stress at work or home that’s been on your mind?"},
  {"character": "patient", "text": "A little. Work’s been hectic, but nothing crazy."},
  {"character": "doctor", "text": "How about your appetite? Eating okay?"},
  {"character": "patient", "text": "Yeah, no change there."},
  {"character": "doctor", "text": "Any dizziness, palpitations, or shortness of breath?"},
  {"character": "patient", "text": "Once or twice I felt a bit lightheaded standing up, but it passed."},
  {"character": "doctor", "text": "Okay. Are you still taking the iron supplements I prescribed last year?"},
  {"character": "patient", "text": "Honestly, I kind of stopped a few months ago. They were upsetting my stomach."},
  {"character": "doctor", "text": "Got it. Thanks for being honest. Let’s do some labs — iron, thyroid, maybe B12 too."},
  {"character": "patient", "text": "Alright. I just want to figure this out, it’s really wearing me down."}
