It’s a simple scale where you rate different aspects of stress from 'not at all' to 'very much.' It helps us get a clearer picture. Does that sound okay?"

Walking has been shown to help improve mood and reduce stress, and it’s a good way to ease back into physical activity. What do you think?"

      "character": "doctor",

      "character": "doctor",
